# Question 2 Folder - Analysis

This folder contains all the code relevant to question 2 for the second assignment of CA4023. I did the first part which was an analysis of BERT vs Logistic Regression models and what the models both worked well on and struggled to correctly predict also. This readme will give a breakdown of the contents of this folder as follows:

- ***q2-analysis-regressionvbert.ipynb*** - this contains the answers to this part of the assignment. It predominately consists of markdown text analysing what both models perform well on / struggle with.
- The folders ***bert-samples, bert-samples-correct and logreg-samples*** contain the text files of some of the samples used to answer the questions outlined in the assignment in the previously mentioned file.
- ***question2_bert.ipynb and samples-bert.ipynb*** are scripts used to run BERT models. These were ran using google Colab. Samples-bert was the file used on our different movie review dataset taken from kaggle. Has some small changes from default implementation.
- ***examples-break.ipynb*** - file used to process our unseen test dataset used to find examples that "break" both models. The CSV processed in this is the "Movie Review and Rating.csv" file.
