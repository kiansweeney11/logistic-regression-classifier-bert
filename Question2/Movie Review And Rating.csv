100001,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"This is by far the best Spider-Man or even Marvel movie, the amount of mood swings it had just kept you invested in the movie the entire time. The fact that Tobey and Andrew came back and brought their old characters back to life is just amazing. I honestly can’t even think of a reason to dislike this movie in anyway. I do want to talk about the end though, that was the one of the saddest if not the saddest ending in the MCU (EndGame is a close 2nd) when you think about it Peter had only been dating MJ for a good 2-3 days since it relays from FFH into NWH and how they both love each other but now have been turned back into strangers is heartbreaking, also seeing Ned walk past Peter without saying hi or anything like that is soo sad. I can’t wait for this to come out on DVD, I’ve already pre ordered it on Movies Anywhere.",5
100002,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Coming from someone who doesn’t like the previous two mcu spider-man movies this is by far the best live action spider-man movie ever. I went in to that cinema in hopes to see Andrew and Tobey also because the movie just look really cool but then when i left that cinema i found a new love for Toms spider-man and also found me new respect for Toms trilogy, they literally gave him everything to just take it all away from him and now i see this trilogy as Toms Spider-mans origin story. Without spoiling anything i will say this movie has given long time Spider-man fans such as myself everything they wanted MCU Spider-man to be, that means no more iron boy jr. This movie as a whole is very much fan service but its fan service done correctly, its amazing writing not bad humour and the cgi is beautiful. 

I also want to say that i now can’t wait for more Tom Holland Spider-man and i am really looking forward to the path they are taking him. Absolutely AMAZING 10/10",5
100003,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Marvel has outdone themselves. This is the quintessential MCU film to date. The layout and execution of the plot is phenomenal. Raw emotion, returning actors of immeasurable talent, the action, visual effects, and character development make this film so enjoyable. I dare say that Tom Holland has definitely become the true Spider-Man within the storyline. This film also offers such an incredible extension to past villains such as the remarkable Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock, the brilliant Willem Da foe’s Green Goblin, the ecstatic (no pun intended) Jamie Foxx’s Electro, Thomas Haden Church’s Sandman, and Rhys Ifans’ Lizard. Returning cast such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Zendaya, 
Jacob Batalon, and even (spoiler alert) the previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield themselves! Overall, this is hands down the best MCU film to be released to date. Jon Watts has created something unique that can only be experienced through the glimpse of the audience.",5

100005,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Best in the Spiderman line, and it takes top spot in the MCU movies.
I love Ragnarock, Black Panther, End Game, and my once favorite, Iron Man, but No Way Home is seamless. From the opening flowing realistic physics used, to the properly placed protagonistic tabloids, Aunt May, and the acceptance of responsibility that brought a memorable and meaningful resolution that leaves you feeling gifted.
No Way Home never went too far one way, nor ever left the thread of momentum.
I've seen Iron Man at least 5 times, and I will certainly have no problem watching No Way Home even more.
High replay value. ",5
100006,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). and they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humourless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.",1
100007,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. Watch Spectacular Spider-Man if you wanna see a better version of a teenger superhero. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.",1
100008,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"This movie showed us someone that we didn´t even know his name. He was following MJ and Ned around. It was just a brown pwetty pwetty NYC boy. Thye brought back mr gween elf, tree, ewectro, octotron 3000, mr sand cheeks from spongebob. my high school project that was a lizard but went wrong and killed everyone. JJJ wasn´t played by Jim Kerry from Sonic the Hedgehog. Also who thinks that MJ is attrative. Micheal Jackson of course. Also ned didn´t even make out with a gacha kid. He wants to s[pend his witty litte time with the NYC play boy. Also why did mr magic hands not stop da litte spelly welly that NYC play boy made. I really loved ANdrew Garfielyyy really muchy e wuchy becausey he playe wellyed my favortite  hara ter. He playes the tere. And tom hanks returned on a late night game show. The death star showed up as spdiermam. And then mr NYC play boe just bliped put of exitance. I weally want to know whip this masked spideyboy who save me cat feam mr trae. Overall, very basett movie.",1
100009,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I'm not a fan of super-turds.  I watched this film only to see how they would bring 3 spider-turds together.  I was not disappointed at all, because  I knew deep inside this movie would suck.  I give one star for creativity.  But in my opinion, I'm tired of multi-verses, monsterverses, Marvel Universes, DC Universes, Covid_19 Universes, etc.  ",1
100010,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I didn't enjoy this movie and what dialogue there was...well it was terrible.  Tom Holland may be a good actor, I've never watched anything he's in.  But the rest, holy jumpin' bat farts Batman!  The story may have been interesting were it not for the fact that it tried too hard to be emotional when it wasn't needed, and tried to hard to be lackadaisical when seriousness was needed.  Spidey loses another loved one..waaa waaaa waaaa...and the end, where he's supposed to be noble and let MJ and Ned get on with there lives?  J Jonah Jameson was right.  Spidey a liar!",1
100011,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Would rate a 3 but no one reads those

First off, the plot was so corny and throughout the whole movie it felt like it really had no value or sentimental impact. Given the fact that they could have pressed the button to get rid off all the villains but decided to “save” them really didn’t rest well with me. Throughout all the Spider-Man movies they are battling against them but then this one comes around me the whole story is flipped. It’s unrealistic and stupid if I’m being real. Secondly, it felt as if it was more marvel trying to pump nostalgia then anything instead of focusing on crafting a good, believe-able storyline. The OG Spider-Man’s could have been introduced in a much more impactful way. The fact that the villains sided with Peter was the tipping point for the ridiculousness. Just for them to turn their backs on him. Another stupid plot by marvel to keep the corny story running. For the rest of the movie it went downhill, with basically zero emotional impact whatsoever.  It felt as if the movie was more just a fan service then anything. The only moment that I felt the slightest emotion was when Peter would no longer be remembered by his best friends. Some of the fight scenes were cool and all and the production was on point. Willem Dafoe played the best role in the whole movie and was incredible. That’s about all I can think of for the positives. The end credits scenes were also very awesome and open up a lot of potential for another Spider-Man movie.",1
100012,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"People bashed BvS and Justice League - Theatrical Cut for being a badly writter movie, and this movie has a 8.9 on IMDB??!! At best, a mediocre outing in the Spider-Man universe. Lack of action sequences, low screen time for the villain and too much time spent trying to make jokes (which were not funny), this movie doesn't even rank in the top 5 Spider-Man movies, and given there aren't that many, its sad. Not trying to give anything away, and its common knowledge at this point, SPOILER! Tobey's and Andrew's  Spiderman were a lot better in this movie. Their acting and dialogue delivery was natural and felt like spiderman, not forced like Holland's. And seriously, after so many Marvel outings and so many losses and tragedies, how can they still show him as a carefree kid! And What The Hell Happened to DON'T MESS WITH THE TIMELINES!!!!!!!!!! sad.",1
100013,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Am I the only one in the world to think this movie sucks? I know superhero movies you don't need to make more sense with it. I love superhero movies too. But put all three spider-men together? And those actors, I know you all can act but agreed to be in this movie...! They must pay you until no way to say no. How are they going to make the next one? Topping up with Alice in Wonderland? Or get superman and Batman to jump across the studio and surprise us in Spider-man 4? That'd be great. We don't need any sense around this movie anymore. I can't wait for them to make the new Spider-man. Start all over from a spider biting Peter again. And when they don't know what to make a movie anymore just put all 4 spider-men together but this time with Batman too. Name it Spider-men: No Way to Say NO.",1
100014,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"after watching the spider-man no way home, in the grand omicron theatre… i have come to the conclusion the world has become devoid of talent… or maybe too lazy to achieve it. movies used to be an escape from reality where anything was possible. now they are nothing more than a commercialized attempt at reaching a targeted audience group with never ending political correctness and an agenda driven message. thank God for the ability to re-watch real movies of the past when the collective IQ of hollywood’s writers and producers added to more than three stars i give the popcorn i ate as i endured the demise of family entertainment.",1
100015,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Got dragged to this by friends, and was not disappointed in how bad it sucked. The film does have stellar action scenes; and I can understand that if you like Spiderman, then you will love this film. I do not care about Peter Parker, he's a goof, and not cool or alpha. I did enjoy him in small doses, as an ensemble character in the Avenger films, but he cannot hold with me to lead a film. The costume is lame, and his powers are pretty boring. Never saw the last two films and will skip the next inevitable snoozefest, epic fail,",1
100016,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I am watching the film tomorrow with a friend, this movie will suck because it has no character development. Tom Holland is going through a difficult faze for what he looks like a kid, you can't tell me a man that hasn't hit puberty yet is going to be the hero. The best spiderman till now has been Toby Maguire, he has everything and I can relate the most with him. Even though they put the best villains in the movie it doesn't mean it will be great, I want movie where everything doesn't feel like it is going to be quick.",1
100017,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"What a load of rubbish  has this movie evolved in 20 years , non rational, wizard , characters  disappearing    - ok it’s super hero movie! How can it be rational? We know it’s fictional- still we loved the simplicity of spider man being just spider man, swinging around and saving people.  In my late twenties,  came the new spider man with Toby. Simple and excellent story line plus well directed.",1
100018,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Lets be honest, for a comic-book movie this has to be thee most disappointing Spiderman movie. Being a spidey fan, I and my friends saw this as the perfect opportunity for Marvel to showcase some cool stuff with the obvious introduction of the other two Spidermen but rather all we saw were unnecessary jokes stuffed in with a plot that was lame tbf. Like yo my man Strange, chill out, listen to spidey and cast your spell!! ",2
100019,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Very little action/story line pretty lame for an action film!
Actor Tom Holland did not look like a 17 year old kid? At 26 and with very visual n deep Crows Feet on the sides of his eyes had me guessing he was 30! At age 26 playing a 17 year old and looking 
30 I’m pretty sure he’s another one n done Spider-Man actor!
As hinted/stated in movie the next Spider-Man will be a black actor. It’s pretty obvious after adding this proverbial nail to this spider man coffin
They don’t have n e other choice but to try n revive the hype n get people to want to go see another one! As well as it did at the box office it does not reflect the actual satisfaction of the movie buffs who actually saw it, who were both excited about seeing the movie to get out of their covid caves wanting go somewhere n also wanting to see a action packed movie that was n e thing but! Definitely a disappointment for me!",2
100020,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,I'm a huge Spiderman and Marvel fan. My daughter is nuts about both as well. I took our family of 7 and of course my daughter wore her new black Spiderman shirt. The acting and effects were great but the writing was terrible. My son turned to me about an hour or so in and asked me how I liked it and told him it was the most stupid movie I have ever watched. We all loved the original spider man movies with Toby McGuire and Andy Garfield that seemed to target a general audience. Holland was great but the writing seemed to target children aged 14 and under. I think the goal or lesson of the movie was to teach goodness more than to get your adrenaline going. I won't pay to see any more Spiderman movies in the theater. We saw this coming in the previous 2 as well. All 7 of us thought it was dumbed down and at dinner afterwards another person told us they walked-out half way thru.,2
100021,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Honestly didn't really feel like a typical Spider-Man film. I don't really like Holland as spider man because he's just not spider man. It's hard to put it into words, he's to much of a child. Maguire played the best spiderman as he was original and made ""spidermanly"" in his films. While the newer spidermen have been made into complete dramas and love stories with strung out scenes that never end. ",2
100022,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"My review is contrary to popular belief. There were high expectations for this movie, and after careful thought, I am not satisfied with how it turned out.",2
100023,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The only good thing about this movie is all the cast. They did a good job even the plot sucks :( tbh the film was too long and there was only a few moments that I enjoyed it :( 
*warning spoilers ahead*
These are things I dislike in this movie: 
- Ant May's death seems to be the most tragic thing in this movie, but I couldn't feel the pain he had to suffer, it's not the sorrow like when Peter lost Gwen that we all remember for life
- Peter's transition from a high school kid to a freshman was not sketched clearly enough
- Dr Strange was kind of like a ..bad guy in this movie. He did not do anything wrong but surely not a cool guy like we all love him before. 
 
The scene that I remember the most? 
When Amazing spider man catched MJ (Zendaya), obviously she's not his MJ in his universe but well done for that ",2
100024,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Alright, so I'll admit this movies got a lot of bad reviews and it more or less flopped at the box offices when it first came out but that doesn't mean it's total garbage. In fact I'd go one further and say that Pluto Nash is the perfect movie to watch after eating on some golden teachers, you'll begin to explore at length the intricacies of the plot as the special effects take you to the next level and beyond. I'm proud to say that I not only own a copy of this movie but that I was probably one of the few people to repeated purchase this movie when it was available on Direct TV, way, way back in the day. For this reason Pluto Nash packs a good amount of nostalgia which is something I throughly enjoy and actively look for.
     Eddie Murphys films have usually stood the test of time and with his recent reemergence back into the Hollywood spotlight you can be sure that there will be people going back to watch his ""Coming to America"" ""Life"" or even ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" movies with enjoyment, so why not make Pluto Nash one of those must see films on your list.",3
100025,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Im going to give it 3.5-4, 

Spiderman No Way Home lacked pace early on, tripping over itself at points and didn't really know the tone it was trying to envisage for half the movie. 

I think what they did well with Goblin, and Doc Ock, they failed at with Lizard and Sandman who for lack of a better phrase 'are just there'. 
Neither of them have a coherent story, logic or progression and are mainly there to bulk up the group scenes.

The Cameos where nice and their parts where very well executed.. character development was the heart of this Film, and you can tell.  Every actor wanted to be there; hero or villain, every actor wanted their character to be relatable and every actor wanted their performance to do it justice and it did... apart from Lizard and Sandman.. who 'just exist'.
i haven't mentioned Electro because there isn't really much to say... He's cool, he's understandable and you can see his logic, but he's also wasted.

What i will say is pay attention. everything in this film has been purposeful; from the words used, to the characters and how they interact. Second guess everything, and you will learn so much more ^^.

Made by people who love Spiderman, for people who love Spiderman.",3
100026,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure," This movie could’ve been my favorite Spider-Man movie if it wasn’t for all the character derailments and plot holes. I recommend watching this, but please don’t let the hype for this movie make you think it’s some masterpiece.",3
100027,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Hard to decide between 3 or 4 stars so saying 3.5

The movie was as a whole a great movie that was entertaining. Their were however quite a few plot holes and moments that left me scratching my head, which is why i give it the lower rating..... the post credit teases pluging the next marvel movie kinda does answer some of the questions however.....

All in all its a movie that is certinly worth seeing (and seeing the other spiderman movies does certinly help fill in alot of context, especially far from home, which i feel is almost required to begin to understand).

My top marvel movie is still black panther followed by end game, would say top 10 for this spiderman......",3
100028,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Now, the reason this movie doesn’t compare to the ones I listed. This movie seems to lack logic, and feels very flat at times. There was a lot of times in this movie where i went “this could have definitely been sped up” or “Ok...”. I heard Green Goblin was better then his previous movie and that he’s sooo great in this... but every villain besides Doc Ock was actually pretty bland to me personally. The heartbreaking ending... it had me heartbroken, and frustrated really. Instead of pushing a button and fixing everything we have to see Peter lose everything with MJ, Ned and all the avengers that know him etc? Thats such BS to me. It does setup an independent adult spider man movie after this though which is cool.",3
100029,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"This is one of the best Spider-Man (Spiderman or Spider Man, I really don't know which to use) movies I have seen. The acting is top notch. Tom Holland and William Dafoe really shine in this movie. The action was thrilling, the CGI some of the best I have seen. 

But there is a reason for the 3 stars. Another multi-verse like Spider-Man movie came out a few years back: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). It was an amazing movie. It brought in characters we had never met before and made a good number of them compelling. There are multiple web slinging heroes, but each one gets their own little montage/explanation. Considering the number of new character, even the protagonist, Into the Spider-Verse delivered on emotional levels I was not expecting. Spider-Man: No Way Home didn't, and considering the multiverse was one of it's selling points, that's not good. ",3
100030,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I suppose Marvel has set itself up for a tough time ahead as they plod on in the MCU's next phase. While I love the Spider-man movies featuring Tom Holland for its charm, humour and relatable feels, this one misses that mark and delves instead into a world of Spiderman nostalgia and yet another potentially world destroying problem created by the superheroes themselves. ",3
100031,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The film itself as a concept is really cool and all, loved some parts of it, with that being said, unfortunately the movie have no pace, no momentum and no plot to hold on to, it's just things happening and ""wohooo"", so many plot holes and weird things that don't make much sense.",3
100032,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The reason Spiderman is the most popular MCU hero as reflected by not one not two but three movie trilogies has always been his idealistic, uncorrupted world view as a teenager and the relatable mistakes , naivete and teenage drama he consistently goes through. ",4
100033,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Thoroughly enjoyable and extremely emotionally satisfying movie for the die-hard fans, with just enough fan service, sprinkled throughout, even if at times a little cheesy, at least those moments always serve the story. 
Casual viewers will still have a good time, thanks to the heartfelt performances of every actor in this cast populated by Oscar winners, nominees and top-shelf talent",4
100034,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Can I just say what a amazing movie this was , to have the old spider man villains back from previous spider man movies was a amazing concept and to have the other two spider man’s back as well is even better. You had a outstanding cast in this movie of course their is the amazing Tom Holland and Zendaya and also Benedict Cumberbatch and the other two spider man’s who are Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire and they were all just amazing. I also recommend if you have time to watch all of the old spider-man movies because then you will know who everyone is in this movie because I have watched all of the spider man movies and boy am I glad that I did because I just understood who everyone else was so much better.",4
100035,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I thought it was an incredible movie and I think a lot of Spider-Man fans will be super, super happy with it. I personally loved it and thought it did an awesome job at cementing the MCU’s Spider-Man as his own character; now leading him into his adult life and separating him from his reliance on mentors such as the older Avengers characters. I’m hoping this will be a stepping stone for a slightly darker Spider-Man tone, that more similar to that of the original trilogy and the Amazing films, and that Marvel as a studio along with Sony learns to blend the best elements of all franchises together in order to create the perfect on screen Spider-Man and this gave us a taste of it, especially in the manner it ended. However despite this I did have few issues, mainly in terms of pacing, references and CGI. ",4
100036,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"absolute amazing movie i had such a blast the theater was very hyped . it really solidified tom holland's spiderman for me , to me he is now spiderman. i cried multiple times watching this movie, seeing tobey back on the big screen as spidey really brought out the little kid that was watching spiderman 1 at 2 years old. seeing the old villains was so damn cool also everything was amazing, aunt mays death broke me i love how they concluded her character.Willem dafoe really stood out he did such a good job he has made green goblin my favorite spiderman villain.Tom is going to be spiderman for a while thank goodness . no more reboots of spiderman thankfully. i could go on and on abt this movie, its amazing",4
100037,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Nothing short of a masterpiece, I loved the plot and ascension of the story, and seeing the villains from previous movies and Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man return really got me emotional and gave me an insane nostalgia rush. Its been a little over a month at the time posting this review that I watched the movie in theatres and its still buzzing news to me that we witnessed such a cinematic and grand return by these characters a lot of us grew up watching as kids, its definitely one of the MCU’s best moments and the reaction the theatres have are priceless. I do have some issues, even though the first act did nothing really bad I found the pacing to be really off, it started off really slow but it picked up after the first 10-20 minutes, CGI was a little choppy especially in the mirror dimension fight and the Sandman/Electro fight. Despite those issues I loved everything, I loved every throwback to the old movies and the memes, and I loved what they did with Tom Hollands Spider-Man and finally making him his own stand alone hero at the end, I’m insanely excited to see where things go from here for the MCU’s webhead",4
100038,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 IMDb rating even after being released for a while but it is as good as they say.",4
100039,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The movie is amazing as an entertainment film. It gives you nostalgia, comedy, high quality production, action and furthers the direction marvel is heading towards. The movie isn't a cinematic masterpiece nor does it have a solid storyline, but I guess considering the hype behind the third and multiverse spiderman film, it is understandable why marvel would focus on money more than story here. They gave exactly what the fans wanted, and what we usually want is to have a good time with out favourite characters. 
I do think the ratings are unusually high for this movie though, which is a bit odd but if you're having doubts about watching the film, well don't. Because its worth the watch.
But yeah, overall production is spectacular, comedy is gold, and the characters and relationships do kinda develop. The Movie ends opens up marvel to a completely new direction and it's exciting to see what comes next.",4
100040,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"A well made spider man movie which is loyal to the comic elements and strong well made script along with gripping moments elevates the film to the cosmos. Finally MCU spider man has reborn as THE REAL SPIDER MAN which we all look for.
Major weaknesses are not much character development for LIZARD,SANDMAN AND ELECTRO. People who have seen TASM and SAM RAIMI'S SM trilogy like me would know them but general audience may not.
GO WITHOUT MUCH EXPECTATIONS AND HYPE YOU WOULD ENJOY IT.
BETTER HAVE A RECAP OF OLD SPIDER MAN movies and few MCU stuff before going to cinema halls.",4
100041,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"the movie was great don’t get me wrong, but the movie was fairly overhyped in my opinion. Obviously due to all the previous villains, tobey and andrew. however just because they were back doesn’t mean its instantly a great film. Towards the end i got a bit disappointed at how easily the spidermen beat all the villains, who were all given their seperate movies against every spiderman and were very close of beating/killing them and were just defeated too easily . The choreography wasn’t good at all except for the end in the final battle between tom and the green goblin ( mainly due to Willem Dafoe‘s brilliant acting). Also i couldn’t care less about aunt may’s death, we were never given a reason to love the character and the only time she said something good was the famous line “ With great power comes greta responsibility” ,  nothing original and was extremely forced. Finally, just a small one but how was spiderman( tobey maguire ) not in extreme pain when the green goblin stabbed him( his reaction to getting stabbed was like getting stabbed by a needle) , they literally joked about the pain he was going through but no he stayed down for a minute and got up. Overall though i have to admit it was a good movie but not that great to the point where i would want to watch it again. I just feel it was fairly overhyped because its of the nostalgia",4
100042,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"The movie was good and lived up to my expectations. Toby's and Andrew's openings were great. If Miles Morales came too I would have been more awestruck. The ending though was not one of my favorites. It's just that,
why? I wish there was a better ending than everyone forgetting peter. And also very non-related: the theater served too much popcorn per container man, just why??",4
100043,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Only fours stars because the final battle (once again Marvel) too much, but lots to Love emotionally. The guest stars were all amazing. Why Marvel continue to spoil all the good work of the first two thirds of their films by having massive unnecessary CGI battles is beyond me.",4
100044,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Overall it's a good movie to watch. Loved the graphics. Although the story line doesn't seem much compelling to me. Love to see the anderw and Toby as spiderman once again. 
The movie is emotional at some points. And the post credit scene steal the show as always. Exited to see the future of mcu.",4
100045,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"Great film! Very funny, nostalgic but at the same time the most emotional spidey yet! Worth the watch guys Sony and Marvel done a great job. It’s a wild ride from start to finish!",4
100046,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,This was a great movie loved when all three Spiderman came into the movie. Didn't like how rushed it was.  Plot was a little off we got no back story from what happened. For example (Spoiler alert) like when electro new Peter Parker was Spiderman that didn't happen in Spiderman 2. Overall recomand watching great movie 9.5/10,4
100047,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"men the movie is amazing. i never thought that marvel and sony can pull this master piece. the acting, the effect, the action sequence everything is really good. this will be a movie will mark on our heads through out the decades now.",4
100048,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,Solid film. Bit OTT at times and would have liked more of a plot twist like with Mysterio from Long Way Home. Would recommend though as it was very entertaining. Beware of squealing teenagers especially when Andrew Garfield appears :),4
100049,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,It felt like the movie was a reset for the current Spider-Man. There were characters and plot lines that would be difficult for him to grow with...so reset not reboot. It was also very nostalgic with characters from previous movies being involved. I actually thought the way Into the Spiderverse handled it was more fun.,4
100050,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,Action/Adventure,"I would rate this movie a 2 Star tbh but 1 extra star for Toby and 1 for Andrew.
It feels like a fanmade movie with no much of any action scenes . very casual entry scenes . very straight forward and predictable storyline.
but CGI 10/10",4
100051,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"This movie was SO BRILLIANT. I could NOT get over the plot twists, nor could I get over the music. Joseph Bishara's musical scores for this movie had me tied into this whole movie. His musical scores contain lots of haunting themes; a combination of viola and saxophone, as well as drums, making up a weird jazz ensemble. After reading a bit more about how Bishara organized the music for the movie after viewing it, I fell more in love. The use of string instruments to make the scores more haunting amazed the hell out of me while viewing this movie. As I watched this movie, I could tell that the more ""calm"" scenes used a lot of orchestral instruments, such as a trumpet, viola, saxophone, drums, and violin. The more ""intense"" scenes used a lot of electronic and faster-paced music. You can hear the crescendoes leading up to what occurs in each of the ""chase"" and ""murder"" scenes. The use of the female soprano voice to tie in the main character to each musical score she was in was also very brilliant. They even seemed to use this female soprano voice to help bring in Gabriel. ",5
100052,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"This is one of the best horror film I've seen ever. It's totally a different theme and way of story telling.And also such a brilliant scripting and direction. Another highlight of the movie is it can maintain it's suspense from beginning to end and can engaged the audience.Each and every scenes are really unpredictable, we can't imagine what's happening next while watching the movie. Horror scenes are very creepy and realistic that we can feel that situation.",5
100053,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Anyone that have this a one star rating...you don't know what a horror movie is, let alone what it should be. 

This was absolutely mind blowing. James Wan has produced yet again, another tale of terror with an amazing plot. The twist was unexpected, no pun intended. The action, the music, and the acting all blended together smoothly. Five stars, absolutely flawless!",5
100054,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,If the acting was better especially the main doctor and side charactor doctors... Then this movie would be a masterpiece.( First time I din't even completed watching the movie due to cheap acting and funny bgms and editing.. But later I kept hope and watched the whole movie .. And I liked it a lot.). Story is excellent and James wans direction of camera angles are good as usual. It's far better that big horror movies like the Nun Conjuring3 etc..,5
100055,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,The beginning of the movie is incredibly cheesy and turned me off the movie that I stopped watching it. Until about a month later I was looking for movies to watch and everyone was speaking about how great this movie was so I thought I would give it another chance. Oh my gosh this movie is so great. Watch it all the way through. There are so many twists and surprises at the end that make it so incredible. Must watch movie!! I love the creativity!!,5
100056,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"I really liked this movie. The beginning made me mad. One part was predictable but It was intriguing exciting and had even humorous moments. Scary but not “I’m home with lights on in the daytime” scary, but it definitely had surprise moments and left open for sequel. I’d go see the sequel. The graphics and action scenes I loved most.",5
100057,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"by mistake i saw this movie at night, and rest all ni8 was obviously sleepless. OMG what film, which shows love and affection has no boundaries like blood relations. climax was mind blowing twist! from the starting till the end of the movie it made me sit in edge, can't even guess what's going on... very different concept best plot, great acting.",5
100058,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"If you value the way films are shot, locations/settings used, and the score/BGM, you will really appreciate this movie. I loved this movie from start to end. I'm 100% with James Wan on the direction of this movie. The cast is great and I really enjoyed the way it was shot, the retro theme music is perfect. If you like movies similar to ""It Follows"" you will love this movie.",5
100059,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Very clever and unexpected all the way through. I love that James Wan went completely against the grain in this horror and for everyone that gave this movie a bad review, you didn’t watch the movie correctly. Not to mention the filming was brilliant. If you thought this movie was bad try watching it again for what it is and not what you were expecting. This is not your typical horror film. ",5
100060,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Amazing, creative, and fresh. You'll either love it or hate it. I loved it because it was so original and never came off as cheesy until the big scene at the police station. With that said I loved that scene, but it could be a reason for people to down vote this movie when in reality that a small part in an overwhelming well produced movie.",5
100061,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"This movie has a nice twist, somehow… it was entertaining and the acting was excellent. It’s just missing something to be believable, kinda like the action for some scenes in John wick’s movies. And it wasn’t scary. Maybe at first but later on, it was predictable. Overall, it was ok. I’ve seen better",4
100062,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,#MalignantMovie is a bonafide horror masterpiece from the genius bonkers mind of James Wan.Its a throwback horror mystery yet feels completely original &  delivers so many thrills & chills that the innate horror fan in me was jumping in glee throughout. Grade:A+,4
100063,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"The concept was brilliant but the execution, the connection could have been better. Don't watch ONE STAR  ratings, stupid people often come in bunches. If they are so knowledgeable, ask them to make a 1 hr 30 mins horror movie . Watch the movie . I recommend it.",4
100064,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Dont listen to film critics.  You know why because all they do is compare a movie to something they like and if it's not equal to it then it must be bad.  That's called lazy! Malignant is exactly what you want in a horror movie.  Campy, gore, violence, suspense and most of all fun.",4
100065,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,What a fun watch. Something that starts out as a creepy house movie turns into something completely different. Even though you figure out the issue before it's revealed it is still very twisted. It's kind of a backwards superhero movie. Totally entertaining.,4
100066,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"You have to see this movie. I like horror movies but not too many of them are good. This one is a different turn, you would never guess. Very different from all other horror movies. Definitely I'm glad I watched it.",4
100067,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"A retro throwback to schlock and giallo films from.the 70's and 80's. The best Dario argento film that was not directed by argento. You have gore suspense,weird music cues, atmospheric lighting ( lots of reds and blues) and a bonkers third act.  Highly enjoyable..",4
100068,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"This was not a good movie, but it was damn entertaining. This movie had weird music cues and strange camera angles and cringy dialogue and I really liked it. Do not go into this expecting a supernatural horror movie like Insidious or The Conjuring, think more like Sleepaway Camp and it will be enjoyable.",4
100069,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,Is this movie worth watching. Heck yes. It has its flaws and some of the close up special effects of the monster are not the best bit this movie kept me interested and entertained from beginning to end.  Would absolutely love a sequel.,4
100070,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"My husband and I talked through the entire first part of the movie, having a lot of trouble staying focused and not fully understanding the plot. About halfway through, you are spoon fed answers until the climax hits you like a ton of bricks. Very strange movie, but at least it was different. We were thoroughly entertained.",4
100071,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,i was expecting a movie similar to incidous or congouring. but no this is defferent in not bad way,3
100072,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,It is interesting..However...I can't say this is an A class movie. It's like...B- or C+ class movie. It just feels like 80s SF movie remade with 21st centruy CGs.,3
100073,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"unique and amazing cinematography, terrible music choices, and a story that hasn’t been done before. a decent experience with great gore. 3/5",3
100074,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,The movie  felt like deja vu. Similar to the Thai movie Alone. Wasn't as great as expected,3
100075,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"It was funny towards the end, not really scary like the trailer. Odd twist bad execution imho.",3
100076,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Could make better. Specially the overly exaggerated sound effects. Last part of the movie, saved the movie.",3
100077,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Definitely James Wan’s worst movie. It’s still enjoyable, but the ending nearly ruined the movie for me.",3
100078,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,James Wan is back with another horror offering but it isn't as fun as his previous work,3
100079,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Malignant made me jump, laugh, curse, and praise. Overall…decent.",3

100081,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,The malignant movie most popular horror movie hai 😱😱😱,2
100082,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"I love horror movies and this was pretty disappointing. I’m actually pretty confused by reviews that are raving about it because I wanted to like this movie, like I REALLY wanted to and it was just… not good. Maddie Hasson did pretty good acting but beyond that it wasn’t good. Super cheesy. Bummer because I had higher hopes for this movie!",2
100083,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,Decent movie story was a little odd wasnt really scary at all its was expecting this to be more demonic ghost and all not sci fi horror thing it was couldn't get fully indulged in this movie either some parts were will done few unexpected twist over all its decent and worth a watch at least once but overall most likely won't watch again well made movie just feel like the story could have been better and scarier takes a while to get into it if you can at all,2
100084,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Less than you'd expect from James Wan.  Whether it's a B-movie, or a self-aware bad movie, the point is, it's not good.  It's silly, clunky, cheesy.  Very over the top, not the subtle, atmospheric master class you'd expect from James Wan.  Very disappointed.  Is it mildly entertaining?  Eh.  Some good visuals, but overall, watch it once and never watch it again.",2
100085,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,Fun to watch at home and laugh at the ridiculousness. Serious horror movie with great twists? No.,2
100086,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"This movie belongs on the Syfy channel. Story, weak. Acting,weak. Effects weak. B movie all the way 😒 The rest of these reviews are super generous... They must be related to someone on set. Sucks...",2
100087,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"If you took away the gratuitous splashes of blood, the structure and soundtrack seem more like a Lifetime movie channel drama. Not what I have come to expect from this Director.",2
100088,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,Disappointed..  The commercials creeped me out.  The movie was hokey.  Sometimes I was bored.  Other times I laughed at the cheesinness and makeup.,2
100089,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,Movie started out promising. I figured out the bombshell right away. Got more ridiculous as it went on. Not worth the time it takes to watch.,2
100090,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"It took two and a half hours of exposition for James Wan to set you up for one of the most visually horrifying image concepts ever, only to immediately drown the horror in the cheesiest ending of all time.",2
100091,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"An idea that might have been good, if they didn't hire the most incredibly stiff, awkward, terrible community theater actors in existence. I've seen saltine crackers with more interesting personalities than literally every actor in this movie, and it doesn't help that the dialogue sounds like it was written by aliens trying to imitate human speech. Only even semi redeeming quality was that the cinematography had a few interesting moments, and even then, theyre far between.",1
100092,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Easily one of the worst, terribly written, horribly executed pieces of trash I've ever seen. It's not even good as in a ""funny bad horror movie"" type of way. The acting is ABYSMAL, the plot is able to be predicted by a 3rd grader, and how this even got past the Sci-Fi channel is beyond me. Don't waste your time, as it's more valuable doing anything else besides watching this horrible attempt at ""horror.""",1
100093,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Way too conveluded. This movie is a utter waste of time. They took a paranormal, monster, psychological thriller with a way to long of a setup, for the plot to be even more apparent. ",1
100094,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"The trailer and commercials said this was going to be the best scary movie out there and it was super disappointing. I am a big scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies, and I kid you not j maybe jumped once. The acting wasn’t that great and the storyline was not as good as the other movies these directors have done. If you are looking for a scary movie don’t pick this one. This is more of a silly gore movie.",1
100095,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,I can’t believe James Wan attached his name to this film.  The acting was so terrible.  The plot was beyond ridiculous.  I was so excited to see this because I loved the Conjuring universe and all its movies as well as Insidious but this film wasn’t it.  It’s definitely not in the same realm of those movies.  Wan must have been bored in quarantine when he decided to make this.  Hard pass.  Big disappointment.,1
100096,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,This was far and away the worst excuse for a horror movie I’ve ever suffered through. It serves up a plot so over the top that you just simply lose interest. And to make it all the more insufferable they insert a John Wick style fight sequence into the mix. Just garbage from start to finish.,1
100097,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"I'm not gonna give a long review here because I don't feel this movie is worth it. I'm writing this review while I'm watching. The terrible acting alone is enough of a reason to skip it but also the writing wasn't too hot either. The characters reaction to situations going on around them was asinine. I can't believe im still watching, the acting gets worse and worse but I gotta see the explanation of what Gabriel is.",1
100098,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,I simply came to these comments to see how everyone reacted to this god awful movie lol I would simply tell everyone to just skip all rating above 2 stars. You’ll get more joy out of the one star reviews than this 2 hour movie. LOL,1
100099,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"I never thought James Wan would produce such a heaping garbage fire. I was extremely disappointed in dialogue and the general plot. With dialogue like, ""I can play the same mind games you can now"" and ""it was right in front of me all along,"" you can guarantee yourself that you will be extremely dissatisfied at the end of this movie. Good luck trying to get into college film textbooks Wan, you'll need it.",1
100100,Malignant,2021,Thriller/Drama,"Literally so bad. I walked out of the theatre. I love James Wan but this wasn't it. There's no plot until probably anna hour and a half in, the acting is terrible, the little things literally don't add up and the the PARASITE.... literally so dumb it was comedic and the acting was bad. I literally sat through with a straight face the whole time, I was not scared one damn time. Anyways don't spend money or time on this.",1

I mean the Jurassic Park conversation absolutely killed me! Its just a funny buddy, hiest adventure move thats easy watching, id deff give it a chance.",5
100105,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Truly not a Dewayne Johnson fan, but this was a darn good movie. The cast was a great mix, Ryan Reynolds kept it live, Gayle Gadot was slick and sexy and Dewayne Johnson was the base that kept it together. The story was interesting  and had all the important bases covered. Funny, action packed and plenty of twists and turns. Great movie HOME RUN Dewayne Johnson!!💪",5
100106,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"I loved it!! I seriously have no idea why rotten tomatoes would’ve only given at 35%. It’s fun, it’s action packed, Ryan Reynolds is hilarious! This movie blows the doors off of the James Bond movie no Time to die. That movie sucked! It was an hour too long and Rami Malek’s character was ridiculous. Red Notice is unrealistic too like James Bond, but what Mission Impossible film is realistic either? They’re all unbelievable to a certain extent.  It’s got an awesome twist ending that I definitely didn’t see coming and it’s a great story.  Watch it! It’s fun!",5
100107,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Another splendid masterpiece from The Rock. Really good movie , lot of fun and action , all made perfect with a crazy twist at the end, just like a cherry on top of a marvelous cake. Simply marvelous. I really do recommend this movie to everyone, cause its a movie for everyone .",5
100108,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Three artifacts, Two master thieves in competition for the number one spot, and one FBI agent trying to clear his name. It's funny (because Ryan Reynolds is a comedic genius), it's got solid action (because Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and charm (because Gal Gadot is an amazing villain with perfect comedic timing). Thoroughly entertaining and just plain fun.",5
100109,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,The film was awsome... I really liked it... I watched thousands of movies in my life and i can recommend this movie because of my experience... If randeep hooda would have acted as an interpol agent in the movie then it would have been a better a lot better choice but still the movie is worth watching... ❤️,5
100110,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,Indiana Jones meets National Treasure. This was one of the best films to come along in a long time. The humor and action never stopped. Watch for Ryan Reynold’s Aviation Gin’s cameo. :) The not so subtle nod to a sequel leaves us looking forward to the next one. Well done!,5
100111,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Very funny, entertaining flick!! Loved Ryan Reynolds character. Loved that there was no gore or excessive language. It was comparable to Indiana Jones in action and banter. Funny fight scenes like a Jackie Chan movie and just all around corny but fun and adventure and lots of laughs. Netflix FINALLY nailed a good action/comedy that the whole family could enjoy. FINALLY!!!",4
100112,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,What a movie. Well when you think everything is over the story is simple a suspense enters. An action packed heist movie which in the beginning makes u believe gal is a vamp but in the end guess what it was. The bond of booth and so called agent hartley was amazing and entertaining. Well should not forget inspector das she played an important role to bring twists. ,4
100113,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Watched Red Notice on Netflix and thought it was very clever and cute. Ryan Reynolds and The Rock were a good duo. Gal Gadot was beautiful and sexy. Some parts of the movie were unrealistic, but so are parts of Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, etc. This movie certainly deserves watching on a Sunday afternoon for some comic relief.",4
100114,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,Such a good movie but strong language every 5 minutes or so. Kids can watch this since they will probably not understand these things. The actors chosen for this movie are great choices! I'm a huge marvel fan so I loved seeing Ryan Reynolds play in this movie and loved the mention of Vin Deisel. I love this SO MUCH!,4
100115,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,Just what I needed to watch on the big screen home theatre on a rainy Saturday. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds pull it off quite well. The timing seemed a bit off but funny enough. Gal Gadot is a pleasure to watch. She fits the role of a beauty with brains perfectly.,4
100116,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"I say it’s quite good movie with some twist yet expected as we cam see that coming but the scenes in the movie does not make you look away for a second and its quite entertaining to watch.. after a long time netflix give a good big budget movie and I mean c’mon it is ryan reynols,dwayne johnson and gal godot…its like a dream movie cast come true, trust me you don’t want to miss it",4
100117,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"The trio is legendary. The plot was predictibly decent and the cat and mouse thing between those three were fun to watch, each and every bit of the story is predictable still the comedic touch of ryan and rock being rock just like any other movie with the gal being entertaining Overall the movie felt like i watched almost 100 times but the trio makes it decently fun and entertaining movie!",4
100118,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Idk why exactly the so called ""experts"" dislike this film. Red Notice is an entertaining action/adventure film with characters that are fun an easy to cheer for. Is there anything groundbreaking about the film? No. It fits the mold of most in the genre. But it's fun. And sometimes that's all you need a movie to be. Solid 3 to 4 stars out of 5 in my book.",4
100119,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"While the plot is beyond ridiculous, and you need to suspend your belief in reality and logic for 2 hours, this is a fun buddy movie. Ryan Reynolds is the only thing that makes this film a success and that's why I give it 4 stars.  He's simple great. Dwayne Johnson isn't bad either. Worth the watch!",4
100120,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,Very engaging movie and a good way to spend an evening. We liked that it was a mixture of cheeky and action adventure - reminiscent of the Romancing the Stone series. The various “locations” /sets were like an travel adventure and of course Ryan R is an expert at the humorous delivery of the many layered jokes. Quite entertaining.,4
100121,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Ok, I admit it. This movie made me laugh. My wife laughed a lot too. Silly, I know. But still, everyone seemed to be having fun too, Gal Gadot, the  funny guy, and the big bald guy, and so did we.",3
100122,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,It's the mordant guy and the chirpy guy. Matthau and Lemon. Will Smith and Alfonso Rubiero. Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold. Party scene straight out of True Lies. A weird lack of freshness-of new ideas in the stunts and plot twists. They all do their job but Johnson normally plays alpha winners and he is the butt of the jokes in this one. The whole thing didn't sit right with me.,3
100123,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Loved the pacing, humor was on point, all leads were exemplary, ... most of all, a FUN watch! Red Notice is that popcorn 🍿 #flick that you won't regret clicking play on a Sunday afternoon!",3
100124,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Would Have rated it higher if it weren't for the ending -- This movie was alright at most, but it could have finished MUCH earlier. I was enjoying Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne's quips at each other and the humor at the wrong times.. but the ""Plot Twist"" killed it. Not only was it unoriginal, but it was plain stupid. If they had left off with her going to prison that would not only shorten the movie, but it would open a window to a potential Second Film that would make sense.",3
100125,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,The film is a bit of fun. Not to be taken seriously. The three main actor's work well together. Worth a look on netflix. Would try something else in the Cinema.,3
100126,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"An exceptional film. The action and suspense was absolutely thrilling, but the end was disappointing and confusing, therefore i felt the need to give three stars. The ending was not properly executed as I hoped for, and did not align with what I saw in the beginning.",3
100127,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"If you are a fan of Gal Gadot then it's a must watch movie! However, the weak story line, poor execution of screen play and average quality VFX push me to put 3 out of 5 for this movie.",3
100128,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,I liked the film and I like that Gal gadot and Dwayne The rock Johnson and Ryan Reynolds we’re in the film. But the thing that I didn’t like was all of the twists and turns. Don’t get me wrong but I like a couple twists and turns in a movie. But in this film it had to many twists and turns.,3
100129,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"I can still work properly while watching it. It's not a movie that will pull me away from what I'm doing. Reynolds is still like Deadpool without the Mask, The Rock is still the same like every other roles he played, and Gal is still gorgeous, but wish she could play roles that doesn't really deal with how good she looks. It was okay I guess",3
100130,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Passed the time, killed some brain cells. It was never going to set the world on fire with the cast... but if your bored with some spare time, great. Bit annoying the scene with the taycan, could have been a fantastic show case of the car, but that's not what we got. Saw the plot twist coming from a miiiiiiile away.",3
100131,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"The Rock literally does the same movie over and over. The swerve in this one to spice it up is that he ends up being the bad guy, in literally the very same movie he always does. He's funny, and charming and has ZERO acting range. Ryan Reynolds, plays the same wisecracking guy he does in ALL his movies. Same character as always. This is all old and dated. NOT FRESH !!! Skip it, you've seen it and will spend 90 minutes swearing you are watching every other movie you've seen it in",2
100132,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"It's a waste of talent. Hearing that Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot are on the poster will make a blind man wanna watch the movie, but after seeing it, you've got to be disappointed. Movie is not all about running around and shooting guns, chasing art thieves or stealing ancient Egyptian artifacts, the movie has no plot or story, maybe a few twist but it's seem like a movie that started before we got to the theater, so basically we started watching it halfway",2
100133,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"So much predictable. The scene where they credited as Bali doesn't look like Bali at all 🤣. And there was one dialogue in Bahasa Indonesia by interpol guy #Pintu Terbuka# it was hilarious, stiff pronounced. Gadot really can't act! However, the production company is owned by Dwayne himself, he should've had cast Emily Blunt instead Gadot.",2
100134,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"This movie gets 2 stars because it has a bad title. This movie should have been called ""Golden Eggs."" The whole movie is about chasing golden eggs. But any mention of the titular ""Red Notice"" only comes at the very end of the film and those words aren't even said aloud. My number one rule for movie titles is: If the title could have been used for over a dozen other films, then it's a bad title.",2
100135,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"This movie was kind of exhausting to watch. Ever wanted to see 2 hours of clichés? Then this is the film for you. Mildly entertaining at times. It’s disappointing to see studios continuing to waste Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Ryan Reynolds, in compilations of been-there-done-that scenes. There are plenty of better ways to spend $200 mil. #NetflixSellout. “Bad Version inc” is pretty accurate.",2
100136,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Kinda fun here and there with some funny lines sprinkled throughout the screenplay, Red Notice has a lot going for it but ultimately comes off as a by-the-numbers piece of product.  The twists are predictable and the action sequences challenge credulity, quite fashionable in Hollywood these days, and I had a hard time maintaining my suspension of disbelief.  Move along folks, nothing new to see here.",2
100137,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"I initially thought that the movie was fun because of the constant use of cliche scenes, but by the end they were tiresome and kinda cringe. The acting by Ryan Reynolds was good and reminded me of Riley in National Treasure. The performance by The Rock and Gal Gadot was very lackluster and honestly kind of awkward. Some fun elements and such but mostly a letdown.",2
100138,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"This movie was terrible. Part has to do with the poor script, plot was good but the chemistry the cast had was garbages.ryan did an amazing job as always but why in the world did they cast Gal Godot as the main female lead. Her acting is poor to put it nicley. She is beautiful without a doubt but her acting makes me cringe. Overall will never watch a movie with her even if Ryan Reynolds is in it",2
100139,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Personally I did not like the movie I gave it 2 stars because my wife thought it was alright,me I give it one star. I guess it was a slapstick comedy not that funny. Ryan Reynolds acting was the same as always the same old shtick. The story line and writing was awful. It was hard to have no feeling for any of the characters. I really hope they don’t make a sequel. One of the worst Netflix movies I have watched",2
100140,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Do you enjoy fairly cheap looking CGI scenes? Do you prefer your dialogue to be mostly cringe worthy? What about endings, would you like them to be presented as a twist but actually be completely predictable? Well, if you’ve answered yes to any of these then you’re in luck, Red Notice could be for you.   ",2
100141,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"tedious, dialogue felt rushed and stretched to build up character to make up for the lack of development skills. Only thing really cool was the environments and props use but that was really it. I don’t know how to appreciate it I really don’t.",1

100145,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,The movie sucked. It tried so hard to make people laugh that one killed it for me plus poor acting and jumping right at the context from the start with zero buildup whatsoever,1

100147,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"This movie was boring.  I think 30 mins into it, I was about to turn it off but kept hoping it would get better…. Sadly that wasn’t the case and I wasted almost 2hrs of my time watching this movie.",1
100148,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"Too silly to be engaging or remotely entertaining. I started watching it waiting to see if the movie comes into its own and develops into something decent but sadly it never did, so I didn't even finish it, it's that bad.",1
100149,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,Most expensive? Probably they paid tons of money to the main actors. They shotted this film like a few times probs. There is no performance whatsoever in any of the actors.,1
100150,Red Notice,2021,Action/Comedy,"This movie is more Bollywood than a Bollywood movie. I think for the first time, The Rock's acting sucked, it didn't seem natural. So does the movie, it was kinda giving a 'Bad-Fast-and-Furious movie vibe'.",1
100151,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Nolan’s works are always thought provoking and need quite a considerable amount of quality time to contemplate the details and speculate the possibilities, but this very last movie of his requires the highest level of the audience active participation all through the movie! It ain’t no pop corn movie to vegetate in front of the telly!I myself do enjoy being mesmerized and dazzled by the complication of the story and being mentally involved in almost every scene of the movie and that’s why I had a great time watching it although unfortunately I haven’t had the chance to watch it a second time which I’m sure will be amazing as well! I guess those who come to hate it get exhausted in the middle of the way or even from the very beginning because they just can’t step forward in the same pace as Nolan’s narration. They just want some cheap superficial excitement in the form of a sci-fi movie, but the most their brains can handle is Star Wars or Transformers which are pure special effects without much food for the brain!
",5
100152,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"TENET is a masterpiece described in the sense of a Picasso painting. Although fragments are dispersed throughout the film in the sense that to completely immerse yourself into the film, you would need to step backward looking forward 70 steps to see the full picture. The sequence of events within this film can be described as a fourth-dimensional progressive film encapsulating a dynamic sense of reality. I've read many and plenty of reviews depicting this film as a casual idea played out and overthought. But I strongly disagree, I believe the script was simple yet so vast and diverse with mind-bending philosophies that made it fun to dive into. Made it so easy to comprehend and so lifelike to appreciate. Many people in the review have rambled about the relationship between the two main protagonists. But in hindsight that is the purpose of the film as you will see at the end. No spoilers of course, but I personally appreciate the authenticity in how complex yet so simple the dynamic duo worked with one another showcasing a slight use of story arch. But the beautiful thing is this film does not contain one story arch it contains all of them.",5
100153,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"NO SPOILERS - Just came back from the IMAX premiere show here in the Netherlands. What an awesome movie. Once again Nolan plays with your mind in almost every 5 mins. The screenplay, godly camera work, VFX work, acting, fight scenes and of-course the direction is just speechless. The moment you understand the plot and it unfolds in your mind with pure joy and amaze is worth applauding the actors and director. Once again an awesome piece of art delivered by Christopher Nolan. The only drawback being the movie a bit too long which could have been a little short. We understood it was for a smooth transition and connection between the plots but could have been better nevertheless I enjoyed it. Go and watch it if you can. It would be worth your effort.",5
100154,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"How on earth can someone make a hell of a kind movie.Its like you wont feel great at your first watch, but excited at the second one and feels insane at the third and throughout repeat watch. The moment you try to understand the minute details in every scenes, omg its completely insane movie. Your brains never functions so fast to understand compeletely at your first watch. But trust me, try to keep on asking questions and find the answers. There lies the beauty of this movie. For me Inception and Tenet are like equal competitors. Hats off the legendary director Chris Nolan for the idea and hardcore efforts behind this and i have no idea how some sequences are at shot without the help of CG.The planning behinf this movie is mindblowing. And there comes the best dialogue in this movie, which is also about this movie. Dont try to understand it, just feel it.",5
100155,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"It's a film that knows what it wants to be. Everything done was done intentionally. Tenet is able to connect together and make sense in the end. This film cannot simply be judged on one viewing and Nolan purposefully made it this way. It took him over a decade to write the script so yes it is confusing, but if you get to understand it, you will see the beauty that this film truly offers. This film has perhaps one of the greatest visuals ever put to screen. Tenet also offers and amazing musical score by Ludwig Görranson which uses music in both forwards and reverse in order to match the film. The story is spectacular and shows Nolan's passion for film. Give it a couple tries, try to understand where Nolan was coming from and only then will you see the true greatness of TENET.",5
100156,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Took me 3 times of watching to work it all out.... But my God it's amazing to say the least.... taking movies to a new level is what the director has done here, I am more then intrested to see if there is going to be a 2nd part in the future. 9/10 as no movie can be perfect as that would defeat the object. As once you found the answer you kind of give up on thinking about it.... So we keep on looking for perfection in Art and Life.... Bravo!!!",5
100157,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,How the movie unfolds is a masterpiece in itself. Not too pacy but the same time moving forward with the plot. You'll be amazed at the detailed presentation when you see a scene unnoticed and it appears itself after a while  explaining. Visuals are stunning. Never felt things was being forced in presentation at the same time they were necessary as well. Highly recommend this movie (also watch it without any distraction). Nolan is a genius.,5
100158,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Best film ever! I can see why some people are confused and complain about the sound editing, but if you understand something about Christopher Nolan is that his films require multiple viewings to truly appreciate. I wish the film can be released again in theaters as the pandemic took away that possibility for most to experience it as intended. This movie will go down in history to the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, initially misunderstood and now a recognized masterpiece.",5
100159,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"I watched tenet in a normal theater(not imax) and I heard probably 90% of the dialogue with some of it being hard to hear because of the music. It was an exciting experience. A little confusing in some parts but I guarantee everyone will understand the whole movie with multiple watches. The acting all around was great, the score was intense, the cinematography was out of this world. Good to see a new unique movie once in a while. Definitely recommend👌",5
100160,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Nolan does it again! Tenet is one of the most original and well executed movies I’ve seen in a while. Tenet is two and a half hours of entertaining, intelligent and though provoking cinema featuring undeniable epic action scenes and music composed by Ludwig Göransson. John David Washington is great in this movie. Despite not being on the level of the dark knight or inception Tenet is still a must watch five star movie that is one of Nolan’s better films.",5
100161,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Overall, really good movie. One of Nolan's top 3 films for me. The action sequences were amazing, and the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema were top notch. Only criticism I had was that the sound mixing was a bit off. At times, I couldn't really hear what they were saying, but hey, I still understood what they were doing. If only I could give it a 4.5/5. A piece of advice: pay attention. If you don't get a bit, the next scene will explain it. ",4
100162,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"I started watching this movie a while back, and made it ten minutes in. The plot was so confusing and gave so little context. The characters also talked at the sound of whispers. About a month later, armed with captions and an airplane screen, I gave it another try. It took me a while, but I finally finished it. And was it confusing. I still don't fully understand the main gimmick of the movie, but I still thought it was great. The characters all have little details that define them amongst one another, like Neil's snark and the 'Protagonists' fast speech. The only flaw is the lack of explanation. I know that's kind of the movie's point, but still, I needed a bit more to fully grasp it all. Great movie, would recommend to anyone with 2 and a half hours to kill.",4
100163,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Well, this is conceptually a very interesting idea for a film. Nolan puts together a pretty good action packed movie, but it's more like a Bond type villain and his schemes vs a true mind bender that it could have been. The idea is here is not going back and forth in time, this isn't about time travel. This is about inversion of time - what if time started running backwards? How would it work? What if someone in the future figured it out, but it fell into the wrong hands. That is the movie in a nutshell. Like all Nolan films, watch it twice, as you will miss stuff the first time you watch it.",4
100164,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"I honestly enjoyed this more than inception. Action was top tier, the score was great and it was just a clever overall storyline. The fight in the airport (the second time) just proves how good Nolan is at things like this- clearly his speciality he does it flawlessly: messing with time and well messing with audiences heads",4
100165,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"I was crossed between giving it three and four stars. I thought the movie was visually stunning with great actors and amazing special effects. However the plot was in my humble opinion much to complex to effectively follow. I mostly understood it by the end, but it was really bugging me that through 90 percent of the movie I only understand about half of what was going on. I prefer Christopher Nolan's other movies, but this one is good as well.",4
100166,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,Tenet was a mind boggling movie to watch as it had many layers. I really didn’t get the plot of the movie until mid way through. It was very suspenseful with multiple twist and turns that kept me captivated and on edge awaiting with anticipation  what was going to happen next. I recommend this movie because it’s definitely a mind stimulator.,4
100167,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"most of the time I got lost through the movie, didn't understand what's happening but I still liked it because it was entertaining, the action scenes is what kept me watching, I couldn't also predict what's going to happen next but kept me glued to the screen. these are one of those movies that I have to watch more than once to understand what's going on (what's it about). all I remember is that's it's about, something about time travelling, but short trips into the future and saving the world. I recommend you to watch it. it kept me glued on my seat.👍",4
100168,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Tenet is excellent, it is everything you should expect going into a Nolan movie. At the same time, for all its brilliance the movie has one gaping hole and it is that the movie is emotionally absent, that is to say, the movie has little to no emotional core. The movie has one goal that it aims to achieve and does it masterfully but it forgets to ever bring itself back down to earth and occasionally falls into the trap of getting too distant from its characters to the point where when the end is revealed... I didn't really care. I hadn't spent enough time with anyone. At the same time, Nolan has made his most brilliant mind-bender and his most emotionally empty movie.",4
100169,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,The concept is more or less simple.  But understanding the scenes and making connections between them is quite difficult...well it's a nolan movie and what less can be excepted from him. He literally loves to play with our mind. This movie is a sci-fi thriller and it also has a lot of action. Though the movie is not that good like his other movies but it's quite a masterpiece. However I need to watch it again.,4
100170,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"If you are the type of person to enjoy an action/thriller where you have to use your brain you will likely love this movie. Not perfect, but still one of the best action movies I've seen- very entertaining and supremely visually engaging. There might be some plot holes to uncover on a second watch, but there will also be a plethora of secondary and tertiary details to uncover too!",4
100171,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"The exhaustion and movie PTSD I experienced after watching Tenet dulled my appreciation of its technical and visual greatness. With no emotional hook or fulfilling plot or character arc, Tenet feels ingenious yet empty. Branaugh’s evil Sator is the most complex and fascinating character in the film, yet the other characters seem 2 dimensional despite their bespoke attire.  The inversion of time, albeit a fascinating concept, muddles the narrative to the point that it feels more about the concept than the realization of the story. Apocalypse avoided: we can all breathe easier now.",3
100172,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Hmm, was good, felt a bit rushed at parts, could've worked on the cinematography a bit more and maybe how the story was developed, there wasn't really any attachment to the characters, in most of his other films thats prevalent - I think I'm reviewing this compared to his other films and not necessarily films in general - thinking about it I wouldn't watch again of my own volition",3
100173,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"despite its groundbreaking visual effects and strong preformances all around from the talented cast it still feels a bit too much like it wants to hurt your mind rather than your mind just getting pained like in nolans other works. i feel that this film could have some touch ups. but as in the case of all of chris nolans work it has incredible action, great storytelling and incredible preformances from the cast. i enjoyed my experience watching tenet and id give it a 6.9/10",3
100174,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Upon first viewing, Tenet may seem like a blockbuster with loads of deep meaning to uncover; but after analysis, nothing holds up. Unlike many films in Nolan's portfolio, Tenet seems to be spectacle first, story second. Exposition is thrown at the audience at a relentless rate, but with no payoff. The first scene where the rules of inversion are explained have no consequence after another mechanism for inversion is introduced.",3
100175,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Great Comeback of Nolan after the boring Dunkirk. But far from Nolan's best movies- Interstellar still remains my favorite followed by The Dark Knight and Inception. Being a Nolan Fan, expected something more. Though this film has one of the best Action Sequences in Nolan's filmography post Inception. But, character development- which forms a major part of Nolan's films is missing. As a visual wonder- this film is a masterpiece, but without the visual treat- this film does not add up well.
",3
100176,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. He's done so many great movies, including my all-time favorite: Interstellar. I so much want love Tenet as well. But even after the second watch, I'm not able to do so. The plot feels complicated just to be complicated, not adding any value to the story and watching experience. Still quite a good movie and a must-watch, of course.",3
100177,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"After a lot of though, I can honestly say this film deserves a three star rating. I really wanted it to be better, but it just feels incomplete. There was a lot to talk about and it just wasn’t explained too well. The beginning of the film is never explained and the end just seemed abrupt. To top it off, the sound wasn’t mixed and balanced right and it made it incredibly difficult to understand what anyone was saying. Accents underneath masks with explosions going on doesn’t make for very coherent dialog. But the core concept and time play is fantastic. The acting is done well and there’s an interesting relationship aspect between the couple in the center of the story. It’s definitely a film you can lose yourself in and try to understand, but it just wasn’t quite there. Definitely not Nolan’s best work, but definitely worth seeing at least twice. Just not in IMAX and maybe with subtitles",3
100178,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan's most ambitious movie to date. You could argue that he had taken on more than he could deliver. That said, the plot starts well introducing the Protagonist as a worthy hero, the story then loses some traction in the middle and comes off the rails at the end. For a movie that is as much about moving forward as it is, moving backward - it was ALWAYS going to be confusing. But Nolan does make every second enjoyable, if you ""just go with it"". There are some impressive scenes - but it is in no way his best work.",3
100179,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie is not for everyone. It has it's parts where it shines but again it has some parts where it lacks in many ways. Action sequences are tremendous and the concept of the movie is fresh but at the same time storytelling and character development is weak. Viewers can easily miss out on vital details if they will blink an eye. Technically the movie is superb and the background score deserves an Oscar but this movie will only be fully appreciated by the people of the cinema or the students of film making. On the other hand, it won't be liked by mass audience as it can be tiring at times. Some scenes were shorter than they were suppose to be and some scenes were longer than they were needed to be. In the end, this movie will make it's mark but it's not the summer blockbuster we are looking for.",3
100180,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,Not the best movie of Nolan. Yes it has great graphics. Yes some scenes are shot well. But somewhere story does not grip your attention. Excitement is missing. Its a time travel movie with more detailing on what happens when one travel back and called it inversion. Nolan has made us travel through subconscious  and space earlier and the journey there was more exciting and relatable. Yes people may like it for the extraordinary effort put in detailing but movie never keeps one hooked,3
100181,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Great photography . . . excellent actors  . . .  great special effects  . . . great sound track . . .   could I follow what was going on . . . not at all.  For me it was a shame that a director like Christopher Nolan could provide us with such great movies like Inception and The Dark Knight could so significantly miss the mark with this movie.  I really, really, really wanted to like this movie but I did not enjoy it.  For me escapist action~adventure should be exciting and exhilarating with bit of sex and humor thrown in for good measure.  If you like this type of Sci-Fi action~adventure I would recommend  ""Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow""  with Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton.",2
100182,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"A clunky, predictable narrative with poor characterisation, repetitive exposition and subsequently flowery uninteresting dialogue that would feel more at home in a student film or a first draft than a Nolan epic. However, the ambitious action set pieces alongside Nolan's technical competence offers redeeming qualities that make Tenet a gorgeous film to see and hear on the bigscreen even if the story itself ultimately feels redundant and at times boring. That said, I felt the concept of 'inversion' or 'things being played in reverse' translated poorly on-screen often appearing goofy and off-beat. For example, seeing the film's muddled, fat emo super villain running backwards bought laughter to the audience instead of dread - the only thing missing was the Benny Hill theme.
",2
100183,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"The story/plot could've been executed better than this; a plot heavily dependent on the action sequence which happened to be the weakness. Nolan played the audience here, making us watch the same thing twice with a lot of predictability. Making the plot complex for no reason doesn't make it interesting either, just another ""I'm dying so I'm taking the world with me"" and ""I protecting her from her bad husband so i can take her as my lover"" but with time reversed; this is nothing special, but rather a waste if time. Why does the military or special ops  have to involved in all these films with a protagonist who's a rich billionaire and abusive? Actor's and actresses were good. The film as a whole could've by a lot better and didn't have to be overhyped just because it's Nolan.
",2
100184,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"The actors felt stagnated at the beginning but they grew through the 2nd half and the scenery was beautiful (I watched it on IMAX) I have to say I am surprised by the many great reviews.  This film was way too confusing with lots of what seemed to be extra action scenes, just when you think it's over....here we go again, another scene which doesn't seem feasible to happen (getting all these random people and departments together for a shot which in turn unravels right afterward, just easily throwing away what you just went through all this great effort to get). I wish there was more depth to the plot.",2
100185,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Nolan is a genius when it comes to cinematography, however when it comes to writing, that's another story. Tenet can be best described as a desperate attempt to add a ""story"" to a series of unique action scenes, in which characters move in reverse. There is no coherence to the plot, the movie fails to explain either the laws of its universe as well as the consequences of people's actions. The result is a movie with unrelatable characters, wasted in service to a plot that only exists to push action segments. Think of it as a classy version of a Michael Bay movie. Proof of this can be seen in its fast editing, as well as poor sound mixing, which highlights the lack of effort placed in both character building and story telling; kind of like the last few seasons of Game of Thrones. In conclusion this is nothing more than a spectacle, some well shot action scenes designed to impress people who do not wish to think too hard while eating their popcorn.",2
100186,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"2 stars for some cool action scenes and soundtrack only. I am curious to know how they casted the main character. Does he have any experience, or taken acting classes, or undergone any screentests? This guy could be replaced by a brick and no one would notice. There is a difference between being in that cool ""strong-silent"" zone and just being a brick. I think the filmmakers have totally lost it of late - mostly junk coming out from Hollywood and other places. Even the Indian actor Dimple Kapadia who is considered to be a solid actor is do dull and lifeless here. 
Inverted bullets coming in from the future, and the future is attacking us..lol these guys are so dumb and pseudo-intellectual like the Nolan movies - too much mind less soul. Please donate to charity instead of making such movies.",2
100187,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"It's a hard film to follow. Understanding the time inversion is a chore, and even then, it's hard to suspend belief that these people in tenet have been operating like this for as long as they have in complete secrecy. Would the world not take notice at people walking and moving backwards, or card driving in reverse? I just found myself frustrated and stressed out near the end. Aside from that, the performances are really strong, so if I were to watch it again, seeing them in their roles again would be a bonus. Robert Pattinson is great here, as is pretty much everyone.",2
100188,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Great concept about past meets future - simply put time bending/folding - a concept that Nolan has been obsessed with since Inception. But, the incomprehensible, indecipherable and sometimes completely inaudible mumbling of the entire cast throughout the whole movie made it a horrible watch. You could barely understand what the hell are the characters uttering. Being a native English speaking person, I still needed subtitles to comprehend this nonsense of a dialogue they utter. It's almost like the guy who did the sound recording decided to completely suppress the dialogue track. A mumbling dialogue in an already complicated movie is the worst thing that could happen. Too bad that Nolan overlooked or screwed up such a trivial and yet most important part of movie making. Or perhaps, it's a cheap trick to get repeat audience.

100189,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Nolan seems to be missing his DoP Walter C. Pfister, and there is a strong chance that Pfister was more than just a cinematographer. I am guessing he was the conceptualist for his extremely unique plots. Therefore a lot of Nolan films, of late, seem to be more confusing for the narrator than for the audience. In attempting to be different, they're just trying roo hard, and not completely succeeding at it. Hardcore Nolan fans, with less brains may not even understand what the plot is about. Buy hardcore one, with a reasonable amount of brain, matter might find it curious, that his films are getting more confusion from a writer and director's perspective, and the narration isn't attempting to confuse the audience. Its confusing the filmmaker involved. Also, its bordering in the boring now. Nolan is arguably one of the greatest director of the last 2 decades. But, his writing and story telling skills are quickly dimishing. Hopefully, he isn't over his prime, as the master of the thriller genre.",2
100190,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"R-E-E-A-A-L-L-Y....what a load of nonsense. Very surprised to see such high reviews of this film here. The reviews were good enough to entice me to waste 2 and a half hours of my life trying to watch this film. I give 2 stars because they have a workable idea for a good movie but unfortunately they failed to capitalise on it. The script is weak and muddled. Although the seed of the film is promising, the whole thing is so badly put together that it never even germinates. The central ideas are convoluted and the scripting doesn't help put things together in a coherent way. It's like those making the film don't really understand the story they are trying to tell. Add to bad scene management, editing, weak acting and totally over the top, dense musicality, the whole thing becomes an ordeal. A film which tries too hard, to be too clever, then simply can't deliver.",2
100191,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Tenet is the rare blockbuster: Sleek, sexy, and impossibly expensive, it offers viewers the chance to experience what Alzheimer's feels like for the duration of its nearly 3 hour runtime. Blink and you miss something. Keep your eyes open and you miss something, too. Who IS that child the heroine never stops talking about? He never shows his face, utters a word, nor has so much as a minor on screen interaction, so one can be forgiven for not knowing (or caring) who he is, his central role in the plot be damned. One thing's for sure, though: Those who wear red move forwards in time, while those who wear blue, backwards. It's just physics. Thinking of genius visual guideposts like these must have distracted Nolan and crew from developing the rest of the story. Anyways, a conventional story is far beneath Nolan's loftier aims: We're all better for knowing, finally, NOT to touch one's future self, should they be encountered, that fire turns to ice when one is ""inverted"", and that temporal pincer movements are THE way to execute any time-based attack worth its salt. One question though: If the future is so pissed at us because of climate change, wouldn't they travel back in time to stop Tenet's $200million dollars worth of Hollywood carbon from entering the atmosphere? Whoa: Alzheimer's is a rush.",1
100192,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"The central driveline of the love of a mother for her child and the fact she will go to any lengths to keep the child to her, is still strong even though it has been used many times to power the heart of the movie. But it is not enough to sustain the momentum through 2 and a half hours of long exposition muffled by masks and loud sound effects and epic pointless battles in which the epic numbingly loud music fails to inject excitement. Cat and mouse games where the protagonists plans are foiled easily by the antagonist's inside info, became tedious. Tall willowy Elizabeth Debicki works well as a vulnerable captive with hidden reserves of strength who wears her outfits well, Robert Pattinson is great as a jittery passionate warm hearted side kick. Kenneth Brannagh does his best to play the sadistic ruthless antagonist and some the scenes of violence are convincing but he still Kevin. John David Washington is very two dimensional compared to these three.",1
100193,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"The 'Tenet', must have been to make a muddled, repetitive, mess of a movie, and, as usual in a Hollywood time travel movie, that's what you get. The characters in the movie, seem to find being ""inverted"" - going through time backwards, to be something new, yet, for movie making, it's one of Hollywood's oldest tricks; dating back to Thomas Edison's first films. Like those TV episodes in which flashbacks are a montage of scenes from previous episodes, or any number of movies with a time travel theme, the concept affords, or, rather saves, the director the need to generate more material. Where it mostly happens in 'Tenet', is the lead up to, and, during a car chase sequence that has become pretty standard in action films. Watching the same scene again, which, winds up being pretty much the whole movie, with only a slight variation in camera angles, and, oh, is that why somebody or other's car flipped? Or, gosh! I didn't see that car door open, that's fascinating! Naah, just more of the same, again. Plus, the whole theory of ""inversion"" and time travel is explained in mumbles, that thankfully, hide the screenwriter(s)'s complete lack of, well, theory. And, of course, as usual, again, you get that explication in little chunks scattered through the film. The lead actor is especially prone to unintelligible dialogue, which doesn't do much to help his indistinguishable stage presence. Not sure if that's his fault, or rather because of the direction and editing. The movie has a sequel promoting ending, so I guess 'Tenet 2' could be a possibility, unfortunately. Oh I get it! For 'Tenet 2', they'll just remake 'Tenet 1', except it will be ""inverted."" Ugh.",1
100194,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Horrible movie. Even just as a piece of film the direction, cinematography, and sound were disturbingly choppy, unsightly, painful to the eye and ear. The director may have made great movies in the past, but this one deserves a failing grade. The first 20 minutes of the film were very intriguing and lead the viewer to believe this was going to be an epic journey to travel on. The next 20 minutes saw the story fall completely flat and then the next 2 hours you will be waiting for the movie to end. People who like this movie seem to be in a fantasy fan club where the story doesn’t need to make any sense and they make up they’re own interpretation. They will say “oh, you don’t get it” well in fact, there was nothing to get. The story line does not follow and has too many holes to even give them the benefit of the doubt. Story gets an F grade. We get no personality or connection to the main character and even the supporting character, while seemingly likable, has very little personality either. Then about half of the movie we are duped into thinking that we’re supposed to have a deep emotional connection with the heroin of the story; but this connection simply does not exist. The last hour of the movie turns into a mindless chase scene/explosion/anticlimactic cliche that leaves you uninterested with the entire story which by then has completely vanished. Kenneth Brannah as the Ukrainian villain is the only redeeming quality to the movie. 2 thumbs way way down. See it for yourself. I wasted my time with it and was disappointed.",1
100195,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"Speach muffled and under a louder music score as part of sound production can work occasionally to set a mood for a scene, but for the remaining 90% of the film the speach that was meant to be heard to explain the plot was almost uninteligible. As a SciFi nerd, this was just a dreadful film jumping for no seeming reason between locations and set pieces (neither clear in plot line why these needed, nor why this made any sense as a whole for constructing the film - why so many unconnected locations) and the Sci Fi itself within its own premise made no sense and contradictory. Half an idea, poorly written and a confusing mess of direction. Fight scenes far too close views and chopy editing such that many fights lost all sense of who was doing what - true it is cliche to have a white & black for hero & villan, but this was so confusing I just skipped to end of fights to find out what had happened as made no sense during these sequences.",1
100196,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"One of the most meaningless wastes of 2 1/2 hours (which felt like 5) I've had at the movies since the last Bad Boys.  Not a real human character or emotion could be seen.  The story , what there is of it, is incomprehensible, no matter how many times you watch it.  To say the acting is flat-footed is being generous to a fault.  And the accompanying noise of a soundtrack is beyond grating.  Even the visuals, usually a Christopher Nolan strong point, are endlessly repetitive and hap hazard.  I truly expected something compelling about this anticipated post-covid release, and instead found Mr. . Nolan's massively expensive opus to be as empty of message or entertainment as Donald Trump's campaign ads.  James Bond can't return too soon!",1
100197,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"This film had very little excitement for me except the protagonist/lead who showed his talent despite a lackluster storyline that had nothing much exciting that might hold it into a good ""flow"". The graphics and cinematography were engaging but offered no connection to a captivating story. It was honestly rather ridiculous and the backwards and forwards and then flashback and then back at it again were dizzying and dull. While we all stayed awake, I was hoping to drift off even at 15$. Many of the reviews I've read here remind me of the modern art museum with a blank pale blue canvas that critics describe as ""mesmerizing"".",1
100198,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"An appalling piece of cinema that becomes the inversion itself. A noisy sound design that grates ""get me the hell out of here"", a film that has a bare thin ""I don't care plot"", with some of the most gaudy irrelevant and ""I forgot how to act"" moments, the film certainly begs the question why was it ever green lit. The action sequences are lazy, boring and seen it all before. Nothing new or interesting ever pops into the mix. It is an absurdist fantasy at best which feels like it was written and directed, and produced ofcourse, after visiting one of Amsterdam's magic soup facilities. Leave this film to the ""critics"" to rave over, who themselves maybe sporting the pipes. Save your money and watch something else instead, like literally anything else.",1
100199,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"This was undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen.  I challenge you to figure out even the main character's name after 2 hours in the movie.  Don't cheat and look it up ahead of time.  After 2 hours, try and name just TWO characters in the movie.  I feel like someone's run an eraser over my Corpus Colosseum and my brain hemisphere's are shorting out.  I can't wait for the YouTube channel ""Filmento"" to take a crack at this movie.  Anyone that says this was good is just trying to be a smarty pants.  LOL",1
100200,Tenet,2020,Action/Sci-fi,"As much as I adore Nolan for Interstellar, and I really wanted to love Tenet, I didn't care about any of the characters in this movie. The movie is not as complicated as some reviews say it is. It tries very hard, but ends up being like a puzzle box for not-very-smart people, with absolutely nothing inside. I'd really recommend to skip it at the cinema and watch it at home someday. Preferably when it ends up on some streaming platform, and you've exhausted all other options for a nice evening.",1
100201,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"One of me and my sister's favorite actors to watch is Tom Cruise and my sister especially loved his performance in The Outsiders, but this was something that I really enjoyed. I might not have ever seen the original Mummy movie but I don't mind, I prefer this one over the original since I really enjoy the mystery, the story, the performance of every actor and actress, the language used in Egyptian and even the very prologue of how the princess became the way she was after thousands of years. You can watch this film if you want with or without watching the original film first, but all in all I always enjoy watching this movie every time that I can. Above all else I love the mystery of it all, it catches my attention every single time.",5
100202,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"I’m a bit saddened by all of the horrible reviews. I get it, people were disappointed by how it wasn’t “magical”, but also people expect too much from movies these days. It’s a movie. It was no worse than all the other movies they are pumping out. It was fun, had funny banter and they had Easter eggs in it, which I found amusing. Russel Crowe makes a wonderful Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde and it’s crushing to me to know that people were so hard on this film that the producers scrapped the entire project and now we’ll never see the whole thing come to fruition. I truly can’t understand how this movie got such bad ratings, but I guess I’m just easily entertained and go into movies with very low expectations so I don’t get disappointed anymore. I’m guessing it got bad reviews because it was targeted towards all generations but they used movie stars from older movies instead of younger people, and younger people aren’t trying to watch movie stars from the 80’s/90’s. That’s just my guess. If they were going to put the older movie stars in then a cameo from Brenden Fraser surely would have raised the Rotten Tomatoes score by 20+ points. It’s a bit confusing to know what the producers were going for by casting Tom Cruise. But in all reality, it’s a movie. I liked it. My husband liked it. My circle of friends and family liked it. I guess everyone else hated it though. If everyone would just lower their standards a tad when going into movies then they wouldn’t experience the soul-crushing disappointment they all said they had.",5
100203,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"This is best movie for me, i automatically get attracted towards these types of movies.  I love this movie so much. I keep watching whenever it telecast on television eighter English or Hindi.  Not only one The Mummy bust also its other parts too i like i.e. The Mummy Return, Thomb of the Dragon Emperior, Scorpio King etc. my all time favorites movie all this.  I would like if more parts will be made of The Mummy.",5
100204,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"One of the best thrilling experience type of movie and also to experience different things. Tom cruise have done some great action works! But this movie is totally different not action but horrifying and thrilling, story line is also odd but satisfying at some point! Worth to watch one time, if you’re a fan of Tom Cruise!",5
100205,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"I kind of liked the movie. I saw the reviews after the movie but i did not think it as a flopped one. If you hate reboots, I hate them too. But there are some restrictions to shoot the same series like actors get older, there is no story, are need a change for the trend too. These factors are the main reason behind it. We must refresh our memories if their is a reboot.Thank you.",5
100206,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,Really I don’t care what the reviews say. This movie is really pretty good. Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe did an excellent job. I wish they’ll bring the Dark Universe franchise back.,5
100207,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,I have always been a fan of tom cruise. Annabelle Wallis did great job. all actors were great. I don't understand the (-)ve reviews. Loved it.❤❤,5
100208,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"Personally speaking, I really enjoyed the movie. I was rather disappointed to know the film was a flop. I would have really enjoyed the sequel, the way the movie ended really built up the urge to know more and to continue the story. I would really love to watch a sequel.",5
100209,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,Excellent!! Loved this movie! Great acting. Full of action with a little bit of drama. Some scary parts and a little bit of humor. Perfect combination! Will watch it again. Probably a couple times,5
100210,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,I thought this was a great movie. Cruise typically takes roles with good plots and this one didn't disappoint. It was an enjoyable flick,5
100211,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"See I don't care about reviews of critics, metacritics and people. This is purely what I felt. This movie is one time must watch movie. As it's storyline is not different than previous ones. And the new place is added to movie which is good. I gave 4 stars because of concept of movie, graphics and visuals used, mixture of horror and thriller which makes you feel like what's next? , Acting efforts of Tom cruise and that mummy girl ahamnet others. 1 star i didn't gave for not having baseline of story properly and little bit confusing. Also actress I.e. Jenny only have one reaction on face which I think shouldn't be there if you are doing movie like the mummy. This was my opinion. Person who is reading this. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE ATLEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME. Do not reply on reviews and ratings. Just watch it.",4
100212,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"This movie is very different from the previous mummy series movies .The plot of the movie is unique .Fast paced , the ending is unpredictable.I would surely like to see sequels to this franchise hopefully.Tom Cruise is always at his best.The other members have done decent job too.

Story : 4/5
Acting :4/5
Special effects 4/5
Background score :3.5/5",4
100213,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"Sofia Boutella is brilliant as is Cruise and Crowe , I enjoyed this as far as these types of movies go , intriguing story with excellent effects can't believe i waited so long to see it !! Would have been excellent on the big screen for sure , just when you think you have it worked out it takes an unexpected turn , can't believe rotten tomatoes were so low ?? I'd watch it again.

100214,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"A fun movie with a lot of callbacks to the classic monster movies and yes I am away of the reason for this. Its an action pack movie that keeps you wanting to see more of the world that is being developed. Yes, there are some goofy moments that could have been done without  (i.e.) Hyde but overall a fun movie as long as it's not compared to the other ""Mummy"" franchise.",4
100215,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"So I think movie is better than I originally gave it credit for now it has its problems but it's fair entertainment the ""mummy"" her self actually wasn't half bad now I'm not a fan on of the generic zombie army part of it but she was a solid antagonist dr jekl on the other hand was just a mess he felt shoehorned in just for the sake of laying seeds for the dark verse and it just pulled me out of the experiance and kinda ruined the film for me the first go, then I watched it again and honestly it's a decent movie to watch once or twice of course. Tom cruise got to do his running and the mid movie scuffle honestly he surprised me I still would have picked some else as the lead but Tom was better than expected just cause it didnt seem like his kind of movie, some of the jokes and quips work but Tom cruise never seemed like the quips kind of character actor to me and he's not but he still did fairly well just a disclaimer I actually like Tom cruise movies I just dont think Tom cruise comes to mind when I think of someone playing a role similar  to Brendan fraisers character which is what they went for",4
100216,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"It's a classic blockbuster movie. It received a lot of flak saying the movie was meant to be the start of a huge cinematic universe and that it also ignored the creative and technically engaging story-line . But the viewers experience through this movie is surely PHENOMENAL and the scale of this movie is massive. Watch the movie carefully , you will understand the attention given to detail in the animation. Tom cruise is brilliant in this un-ventured genre.",4
100217,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"I had a good time watching this movie, if they hadn't retconned Dracula UnTold I would enjoy it more. The story was nice, the action was fun, and the CGI was awesome. But, things felt rushed and there were too many crossovers",4

100219,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"I dont understand why this movie has such low ratings..It has scored 5.4/10 which is pretty low..It should have been atleast 7/10. Well whatever , I really liked this movie . I rated it 9/10 and gave it 4/5 stars..",4
100220,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,You will like the film. Don't let the reviews mislead you. They went way too hard I would considider it at least a 6.5 out of 10 rather than the 5.2 it was given.,4
100221,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"Not greatest movie but nor was it the worst movie I have seen, does what a film should which is entertain you for few hours. I wouldn't pay to watch ⌚️ it but if its on free you got nothing to loose. Thought cast were good. Loved actress who played the mummy.",3
100222,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"So , the plot was good but the graphics etc... Were not , they failed at creating proper mummies and the monster Ahmanet - they literally could have done so much more basically , they didn't even make the mummy lile a real mummy. So even though the mummies looked like zombies and so much of the power ( which yes she had but wasn't used fully ) and the movie was like a joke on the original - I would love to see a sequel because that ending scene was awesome and I believe they can improve and SHOULD improve.",3
100223,The Mummy,2017, Action/Horror,"It's a fresh take on the 1932 version of The Mummy not to be confused with Brendan Frazier version. Not a bad film if you think of it as a foundation for possible sequels and the ""dark universe"" the studio intends to create. Discard the past Mummy movies from your brain and give it a chance.",3

100257,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I really like this movie. It has a great amount of action and very cool characters. I also like how they add some comedy in there as well. I don’t see anything wrong with the plot, I really enjoyed it.",5
100258,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Fun movie!  The soundtrack is awesome!  From beginning to end... total fun for those who enjoy adult humor!  Not for the kiddies.  Lots of violence, but... even that they figured out a way to make it funny!  Loved every character.",5
100259,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I absolutely love it!!!! Its one of my favorite movies!!!!  😍 everything about this movie is awesome!! It has awesome action, fighting & i absolutely love the acting!! Everyone did an amazing job on this movie!😊  My favourite character is DEFINITELY Jared Leto's Joker!!!😍😍😍",5
100260,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I don't understand why this film got the hate that it got, though I can understand people wanting more with Joker and Harley Quin. But other than that I actually really like and enjoyed this movie. Plus even if the film isn't great, Heathens is an AMAZING song!",5
100261,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I know this one gets alot of hate but its not meant to be a deep film where the characters find themselves and rebound from their wicked ways. Its a gritty live action comic type horror sci-fi. It shows even the most lost, gone astray criminals can find some redemption and some sense of honor and unity. SPOILERS. Dead shot to do one last deed for his daughter to remember instead of him being a killer. Diablo to sacrifice himself for surrogate family to make up for being the demise of his immediate.  Even Rick Flagg changing his ways from judgmental,, self righteous soldier to understanding and seeing through the flaws of his outsider misfit comrades to form a team to save the soul of the world and the woman he loves. Release the AYer cut of this film. Its said Hollywood stepped on it id like to see his version.",4
100262,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Definitely really funny, had some great actors in it, really a great way to make super-villains do somey good. David Ayer did a good job directing, the plot and the storyline could have been better, I'll admit there were a few things wrong with the film, but the actors and characters made it better. The action scenes were pretty good, not the best but good. I would recommend watching it, not as good as Man of Steel or Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice but would recommend. 7/10 is my rating for Suicide Squad.",4
100263,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"It’s a good movie a lot of people hate on this for a valid reason but I personally enjoyed it. The movie was fun and exciting I liked the characters and the mission they went on. Joker is the main issue he’s not joker he’s more of a watered down joker, he isn’t as crazy and he has very cringe dialogue. The other issues with this movie  is that the whole plot is just weird and not super interesting and a few of the action scenes could have been better. Overall 7.6/10",4
100264,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I started watching on TV expecting to change the channel pretty quickly. I'm not a comic book person so I didn't think this would appeal to me. But, I was wrong, it hooked me and I ended up really enjoying it. Margot Robbie was fantastic and Jared Leto (I had no idea it was him - I had to google to find out) was outstanding too. I'm looking forward to checking out part 2 when it comes out.",4
100265,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Such a good movie. Much better than the first suicide squad in that the characters are more developed and have distinct attributes that set them apart from one another, and I’m not just talking about their powers or abilities. Definitely a must watch for not only DC fans but also those who love action.",4
100266,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"While I won't deny that this film has it's flaws, I will point out that when judging a film, I tend to focus more on the positive aspects that came out of it. It was Margot Robbie's debut as Harley Quinn after all. Also, I like to think of this film as the template for the new one that James Gunn is directing. You can't achieve total perfection without hitting a few bumps along the way if you know what I mean.",4
100267,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,ok i'm gonna keep this short but anyways this movie is AMAZING! the characters are all funny and cool. the soundtrack is the best i've heard in a while. the end of the movie kinda sucked though. i wish deadshot would've got to see his daughter more.  and also one more thing.... WHY WON'T JOKER STAY DEAD?? thats why i gave it four instead of five. overall this movie was great though.,4

Director By David Ayer And Everybody That Work On This Movie Will Saw This Movie In 2016 Back In Theaters When It Come Out I Didn’t Like It Because Of Jared Leto Joke And I Don’t See Since Now In 2021 Five Years Later I Like The Second Time A Little Bit But I Will Give It Four Stars It Not That Bad Of You See The Second Time It Ok 😒",4
100269,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I thought the movie was really cool, my favorite characters in the film were Margot Robbie's as Harley Quinn, Will Smith as Deadshot, Joel Kinnaman as Col. Rick Flag, and Jared Leto as the Joker. But, as much as I really liked this movie, I want to see the full director's cut of the movie. Because I know for a fact that there's so much more.",4
100270,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,What can I say but I liked the movie. I really can't believe they didn't  give Jarad Leto his own Joker movie . He was great as the Joker. I also liked all the other character portrayals. DC comics has gotten darker as it's gotten older and much better. I wish they would do more.,4
100271,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Kinda liked it. The action isn't as well handled as it could be. The joker is kinda irritating. Kitana is underdeveloped as a character and in terms of violence - essentially they give her nothing to do. The smith/kinnamon tension is tedious. But the payout is way more adult than a lot of other super hero movies. The El Diablo character rejecting illusions in the face of his prior horrific actions is kinda beautiful.,3
100272,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I don't get the hate behind this movie. I felt it was a decent movie. Unlike most DC movies, it had a very good mix of action, comedy and drama, and i honestly felt relieved to see a DC movie that had good action sequemces and enough comedy to give it a worthwhile experience",3
100273,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Harley Quinn is the only delight in this whole movie. Totally overrated and I’m still not sure as to what powers some of these super villains have. Big cast but a total disappointment. And even the good songs come after the movie is over.,3
100274,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Suicide Squad I can't say it's a bad movie but I'm really the only one who thinks it's a good idea to have a gang of criminals as a team to save the world ... Anything good would try to keep some criminals under control and with the bombs ready I don't think they would succeed !!! But it was quite interesting!,3
100275,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"The movie surely could do fine...I mean they didn't held back a bit while recruiting the talents and neither they held back at finance and productions if only they would have worked on the scripts, the plots, the story line little more it could have been the next best DC movie after obviously Batman : The Dark Knight... All in all its mediocre movie and nice to watch for the ones who are newly getting introduce to  and stepping inside for the first time in the Mysterious and exciting world of DC",3
100276,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Average ....script is poorly written ... only deadshot and diablo character development were great.. Harley Quin was potrayed well..Jared Leto's joker is just disappointing in this movie he's barely in there and just does some stupid dialogues.... There are many plotholes, not much explanation....messy movie...",3
100277,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I've only seen the film today, and I have mix feelings about it. Firstly, the only characters I know are only Batman, The Flash, Joker and Harley Quinn, the others, I don't even know the rest of the villains in the movie. Also, there wasn't enough fighting scenes or anymore funny one-liners. But I'm giving the movie a three-star anyway.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️",3
100278,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,People say they hate this movie I really don’t have a problem with it like the Comedy is good and Margot Robbie kills it and will smith also always does great,3
100279,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"#ReleaseTheAyerCut .This movie is just a moderate action flick with great actors and an amazing look that wasn't used to the fullest that it could have been, if you like that joky not so serious explosive stuff it's not bad go watch it, but it's not as great as it could have been, although it's better than most Marvel movies.",3
100280,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,The suicide squad is a pretty good movie but i just am not the biggest fan of Jared Letos joker. I am not the biggest fan of the tattos but i love the Harley Quinn in this movie I found her amazing and i loved all the fight scenes.But some scenes in the movie were just unnecessary and just made no sense but besides that the movie was okay but not the best but that's my opinion.,3
100281,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"As big as this movie was in 2016 where halloween was taken over by a storm of 5 year olds wearing ""Daddy's Lil Monster"" on a crop top. This movie was not as expected or hyped however it is one of the most recongnizeable superhero movies somehow. I have a lot of respect and sadness for David Ayer who's movie got chopped to clips and recut entirely with his name slapped across the front. This wasn't his movie and that is entirely the fault of Warner Bros. This movie had so much potential that was later explored by James Gunn who hit it out of the park. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn will always be iconic for her role in this film and she was the best thing that came out of this movie.",2
100282,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"a secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillians to save the world from a powerful threat in the form of hot young superpower named enchantress in exchange for reduced sentences. somewhat amusing superhero movie has it's moments similiar to watchmen (without the graphic violence) but the script is muddled, thinly written characters and choppy directing. special effects are ok (a CGI mess) and not to mention the non-stop licensed songs are shuffled and very grating here and doesn't help anything. the only thing i liked about it was margot robbie and cara delevingne two great actresses who have a great future! the rest of the movie was so-so or boring. a 4 out of 10.",2
100283,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"This may be 4 years late but I am just gonna speak my thoughts. This movie is a complete abomination of a DC adaptation. Suicide Squad has ZERO central plot because most of the runtime is made up of character backstory and introduction. In the end, no one gives a damn. The Leto Joker is a complete joke in the movie who has no significant purpose or role but instead just functions as a stupid distraction meant to slow down the progression of the story. The writing is trash, the narrative is trash, portrayal of Enchantress is trash, basically the entire movie is trash. I hope the next movie will do the characters literal justice. Just for this once.",2
100284,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"I can’t overcome the fact that Cara Delevingne can not act at all. You would think that in a movie like this, it’s enough to just pose an look intensely, but she can’t even do that. Please stop experimenting with her as an actress. The movie is otherwise exactly what it is advertised, no complex characters or plot, lots of action, good music (no original score to confuse you), blood and the good villains win.",2
100285,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"First time I watched it, I thought it was good. Next few times (I watched it), it wasn't that great (when I came to realize it). Not sure why people like this movie better than the 2021 version. I wish we could get a directors cut of this movie. I bet Warner Bros is too scared and cheap to make it. If it weren't for the name-brand actors in this movie, it would of really sucked. Anyway, thanks for reading my short review! Go DC!",2
100286,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"There is a far line between a fun movie and a good movie. An example could be the godfather, a good movie that isn't that fun to watch. Suicide Squad was fun to watch because the entire duration of the film I was just making fun of it with my friends. Here is a drinking game, everytime there is a bad plot line, dumb quote, or bad CGI scene, take a drink. Oh god you will have the worst hangover ever.",2
100287,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Joel Kinnaman plays an annoying character. Margot plays a good Harley Quinn and I Like Will as Deadshot. Viola is super evil and I like that a cute Jared Leto is under all the make up for the Joker. I like the team interacting but find that the story could have had more potential.,2
100288,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"When it came out in 2016, I was pretty young around 10-15 years of age, but now lookin' back at this movie is pretty dissapointing. There's not much to say here cuz this movie is just to modern-ish and completely twists the Joker and Harrely Quinns personalities and backgrounds. 2 stars than 1 because the action was pretty enjoyable tho the story and the orgins of some of these characters just make no sense.",2
100289,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,I could not get into this film. Was this the most expensive student film ever made? It felt that way. This was the film that made me appreciate how Marvel are handling their films. I keep asking myself - how could Will Smith choose this role and turn down DJango? I'll never know. I'm sure if I was 10 years old I might appreciate the film... probably not actually.,2
100290,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Suicide Squad is a complete disappointment for the DCEU though there are some scenes that feel better alone the movie has no point. There are characters that are wasted and the story and script doesn't make any sense. Suicide Squad is a bunch of pointless, senseless scenes with beautiful soundtrack from Steven Price edited together.",2
100291,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"This is simply the worst movie adaptation of a comic book ever. yes worse than monkeybone, catwoman, Fantastic four (2015), Jonah hex, Elektra, Ghost rider even Green lantern. I paid money to see this in the cinema and regretted that decision only 15 minutes in when i realised the entire film had been edited like a music clip. this is trash at its most expensive. My reaction was to laugh as it was the worst movie going experience i have had in 28 years. F#### Marvel? hahaha get out of here David Ayer.",1
100292,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"This is a trashcan full of mildew and feces. Jared Leto as Joker is the worst interpretation of the character. Most of the characters are not needed  and are not shown their potential even though the good characters brag about. KIller Croc is a walking stereotype and Enchantress, which could have had potential is a car dealership blowup. El Diablo is okay, while Deadshot, who is a villain, is not acting like one because Will Smith is playing him. The only good bits this movie has going for is its soundtrack, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Harley Quinn even though she is really sexualized in this movie.",1
100293,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,i know everyone legit loved it but i couldn’t get into it at some point after the first 30 minutes i left. They dropped a bunch of character plot and editing was all over the place for me to get into it. The trailer really got me excited for this piece of garbage of a movie. Really upset me too because i saw it opening week total waste of a trip to the theaters. 😑,1
100294,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"To be honest I watched this movie when it first came out and even though I’m 4years late with this review I hope it helps anyone Right this moment searching for good movies to watch . think of of this movie like this , it’s basically the lamest marvel story line + lord of the rings ( don’t even ask me why there are witches in the story line ) all it was missing from being a total derailed concept was flying dragons and transforming cars . That’s how confusing the movie is 😓",1
100295,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"Im late to the party with this review. But can someone tell me why anyone thought it would be a good idea to put regular ppl against magical beings. Like why of all the villains they could’ve chosen did they fight a super powerful sorceress and her brother, which has been disintegrating everything he touches but for some reason decides to backhand two ppl at once instead of just disintegrate them, and they win? Riddle me this, what in the holy plot armor was that Batman?",1
100296,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Never should of been made. I cant believe will Smith got involved in this pos movie. Birds of prey looks better. When I heard the plot I laughed and was falling asleep watching it on bluray on my 2500 home theater system,1
100297,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"This has to be the worst DC movie ever!!! There were some issues because the pacing was just horrendous. I didn't know what was going on and I was so confused because one year after the events of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, every villain in the team are being described but I found out that they are all going to defeat the Enchantress. Also, Jared Leto did such a terrible job playing the Joker and I prefer Heath Ledger's Joker in the Dark Knight.",1
100298,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,This movie is a catastrophe I originally thought it would be better than Batman V Superman but my hopes were like shooting down a helicopter with an RPG this movie was an absolute nightmare start to finish and I don’t mean a nightmare like it’s scary because it’s not whatsoever in any way shape or form for me this movie had potential to be great but turned out to be horrible easily one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen in my entire life it’s so dumb I honestly don’t know why they even considered and made a sequel (I know it’s not cannon to this one) but still did not need or deserve a sequel,1
100299,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,Best biggest let down of latest action comic based films. Was so disappointed during the whole film. I dont dare give it another chance on TV for free. Couldn't believe I'd paid money to see it at the pics. Hesitant seeing the new 2021 version. Hope it's better.,1
100300,Suicide Squad,2016,Action/Adventure,"And DC wonders why Marvel does so much better in the Box Office...  This movie was HORRIFIC (being a comic book reader), and DC has yet to put out anything worth spending money on.  Harley Quinn and Joker were the highlights - which lasted 10-15 minutes.  Other than that.  WORST DC MOVIE THIS DECADE!",1
100301,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,It’s a complex movie and a must watch if u are an avengers fan. It’s refreshing to see finally a female superhero movie among all other avengers members. The Story has been intelligently spun and is definitely engaging. Excited to see Captain Marvel as a super strong avenger member. The humour amidst all the action gives some lighter moments too. Chemistry between Capt. marvel n nick fury is charming.  Annette Benning as Dr. Lawson though played a small but robust part and surely impressed us all with her appearance. Brie Larson looks subtle n strong as Vers n Captain Marvel. She did justice to her role too. Looking forward for more female avengers movies from marvel like captain marvel 2 and black widow.,5
100302,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I don't care what other people said about this movie, but personally for me, I really enjoy and love this movie so much. To me, they perfectly executed the character of Carol Danvers and her held-back emotion is something that we should take consider of someone who's been trained to be like that for 6 years with no memories in her life. Plus, there's many powerful scenes that gives me goosebumps too! Like the ending scene where she said 'I got nothing to prove' got my eyes welling up with tears as I could relate to that in certain aspect of my life. Also also this movie also never fails to make me chuckle every now and then huhu. Inspiring, light-hearted and thought-provoking. I'd watch this again anytime :))",5
100303,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Captain Marvel is one of the best Superheroes. I didn´t exactly know what to expect because I haven´t read any of the comic´s but I absolutely loved this film. It shows strong female empowerment, the funny actors- Brie Larson, Sam L. Jackson and Talos- and an amazing twist I did not expect. I did love Goose and he did steal some of the show...but I feel it was all Captain Marvel AKA Carol Danvers. Before my mom and I went to go see the movie, I had looked up some of the background of her. Like that shape shifting Skrulls that were actually supposed to be the bad guys and the Kree were the good. I was surprised at the change they made but loved the results. Ben Mendelsohn played a perfect Talos and with his British accent, made the character sexier. I loved Jude Law...but my absolute favorite part of the movie is when Captain Marvel broke free from the Krees control and fought like a strong woman, never once backing down. She is the strongest Avenger yet and I love that. Pro strong Woman.",5
100304,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"WOW! I can't even begin to start on how much I LOVE this Marvel movie. My family is just getting started in watching the marvel movies, as we are watching them in timeline order on Disney+. I didn't care much for Captain America but had high hopes for this one. My expectations were EXCEEDED! The cat was Hilarious! And Samuel Jackson was SO perfect as the character of Fury. And don't even get me started on the Captain Marvel character. She is such a great role model, she finds her powers by controlling her emotions and that's why I relate to her so much. The plotline was so easy to follow, nothing weird there.  Overall it was the BEST Marvel movie I have seen so far. 1,000/10",5
100305,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I personally really enjoy this movie.  It’s refreshing to see the main character of a superhero/comic based movie be a woman, and I think that Oscar winning actress Brie Larson played the role exactly how she was meant to.  The CGI throughout the movie was very strong, and the writers did a good job of portraying the life of women not only in the armed forces, but how they were and are often treated.  Overall, I think that if you’re the type of person who enjoys action, and good plot, superhero’s and aliens, you should definitely watch it!",5
100306,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,This movie has links with Dark Phoneix. The energy is exactly the Same. Remember movies come from the house of pieces. So it all comes from source our creatuve conciouness she has Jurisdiction Jordi as to what get shwo on TV. When something is being play ▶️ that should be or Restructuring or restricted because she noticed it kit health or people aren't coping well in the collective with the Downloads lady venus. She takes it as a peronal mission to understand. The movie are so abundant right know but nobody sit and analysis what they mean to them and how they affected thier life. Personally. Movies are intense for me and I have to integrate sit analysis and observe all that come through for me. When I watched squid 🎮 🥅 🏑 that was very dangerous for me to be reveal to. As I was extremely vulnerable. And my opinions time and resource of knowledge and insight where not appreciated. Love Always your golden light ✨ 💛,5
100307,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie was really enjoyable. Brie Larson played Captain Marvel very well, she was such a likeable character and her dynamic with Fury was really funny. It was cool to see a younger and more laidback version of the Fury we know from prior movies. Most of the 1 star ratings of this are from misogynists who hate powerful, confident women. I really like how it tied into other Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers. The 90's setting was also fun.",5
100308,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie is a perfect combination of dignity and robustness. Captain Marvel is my favourite character and has her unique persona kept me glued to the adventure of her in this film. The movie kept us clinched to the unravelling of the past of C. MARVEL. A true epitome of a feministic movie, she is without any holding back attitude and Brie Larson truly did justice to this unique and powerful character. She has kept the poignancy at the same time powerfully implemented the hard nature of the character. I love the movie and Marvel universe has indeed bloomed our own Captain Marvel. 8/10",5
100309,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,This movie was a really good origin story for Carol Danvers! It was both funny and really interesting! And I  was so happy to see the Skrulls and Monica Rambeau join the MCU! Young Nick Fury was great and on how he lost an eye. Was also very happy to see that Marvel finally made a movie where a female superhero was the main protagonist! I recommend this to literally anyone even if you haven’t see all of the MCU films.,5
100310,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie is good but I say with confidence it is not the best marvel movie by a long way. Don't get me wrong Samuel L and brie Larson were great! It's a funny movie with exciting post credit scenes, great action scenes and a plot twist with the kree and skrulls. But it just lacked that extra spark and didn't quite have the constant thrilling feeling most other marvel movies have. Also i expected a lot of the movie to be in space but a large majority of the movie is set on earth and she never really felt like or really became captain marvel untill the end. It's still a good movie for sure but lacked a few things. I'd rate it a 7/10",5
100311,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"One of the best MCU movies, in my opinion. It has an equal balance of seriousness, humor, 90s pop culture, badass scenes and representation. It may be a fairly simple superhero movie but it's certainly worth the watch. It keeps you on your feet with fight scenes, twists, character development and iconic Marvel humor (as well as Stan Lee's appearance of course). I highly recommend the movie for any superhero fans/MCU fans, action movie fans, sci-fi fans and just anyone who enjoys a funny, and entertaining movie.",4
100312,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I saw a lot of negative feedback even before the movie started hitting theaters but now I've watched it by myself, I feel most of those are pointless. This is not an all time classic, yet a very good movie. Great casting and acting. Cool story with a plot twist and is crucial to Avengers: Endgame final outcome. Fascinating special effects. I'll give this 8 out of 10.",4
100313,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Rating: 8.0/10 This is a good Marvel movie on this year. From the beginning it is a good introduction of a first female superhero. If you are looking for a good action film with a good cast and a story this is it. The scenery of the movie is amazing and the action scenes look amazing. there are even funny scenes in this film. To all of you, go see it you won't regret it !! Overall, Good Acting Performance By Female Superhero.",4
100314,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,I enjoyed Capt Marvel for what it is; a live action Super Hero Comic Book. It stayed true to that feeling and didn't come off as being pretentious or trying to be something it isn't. I also like seeing women being given stronger characters and Marvel Universe does that well.,4
100315,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,I honestly don’t know why some don’t like this movie. It’s funny & has pop culture references. The acting is very well considering it has Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson as an iconic duo (along with Goose & other actors we all know and love),4
100316,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Captain Marvel is a super hit picture. Plot was absolutely mind blowing. Great action, humor and amazing plot twist. Bad acting by the actor who played the role of captain Marvel. Excellent acting by Samuel L Jackson. Rating -4.5/5 stars. A must watch.",4
100317,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,I feel like it helped explain how Nickolas Fury got the Tesseract in the first place. I also liked how there was a major plot twist towards the end. Even though a times it could have been better I still would like to say thanks for such a great movie.,4
100318,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"When I watched the trailer, it didn't catch my attention. When I watched it on the Amazon Prime list I put it on my list, but until now I had not wanted to see it. I regret not having seen it before, it is entertaining, I liked it and I would like to see more sequels. And yes, I was pleased to see such a powerful woman, it is not very common to see characters like that.",4
100319,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,I enjoyed it. Samuel L Jackson is hilarious and Brie Larsen was fun to watch. The story itself was as good as any of the Marvel films. Not sure why it received mixed reviews.,4
100320,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"While Captain Marvel is a great movie, it does twist up previous movies like Captain America: The First Avenger. I wish that the directors thought a little before doing that because if Goose had the teseract where did they get it from without finding Captain America 30-40 years earlier? Again it is a great movie but it does cut off the franchise a little bit. I still recommend you watch it to get your fill of space monsters, female warriors, and space people who are both evil and misunderstood.",4
100321,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The latest MCU entry gives Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel her own feature (right before being drummed into the Avengers ranks in next month's End Game to do battle) so now audiences will get to see who this woman is & what exactly she'll bring to the Thanos party. Anyway, Marvel, known as Vers, is part of a Kree elite fighting unit holding the Skrull (a shape shifting malevolent race which I first remembered from the 60's Fantastic Four cartoon) at bay as they police the galaxy but due to a mishap when her team attempts to retrieve a spy from a desolate planet, Vers is captured & tortured by the Skrull to gain knowledge of a light speed engine who's creator (played by Annette Bening) died in protecting its location back on Earth. Vers escapes her captors, reaches Earth but soon, due to the after effects of her time spent w/the Skrulls, starts to doubt her existence as evidence shows she's from this planet & not a Kree as she was led to believe. Incorporating de-aging makeup again, we get a younger Nick Fury (& Coulson as well) teaming up w/the lost 'proud warrior' to right things before the truth overwhelms all involved. Handily written & directed by Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck (Sugar/Half Nelson), this film has to do mucho heavy lifting, bridging 2 important sequels, introducing a new character & being a female empowerment manifesto which it does successfully in spurts & starts but being most audiences just want to get this Cliff Notes version of the character & her background out of the way for the main course to come, no one's going to come away so distraught that they'll swear off Marvel forever.",3
100322,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Generally speaking, all MCU films are better than their DCEU counterparts. However, if there is an exception, it would be this movie. If Captain Marvel is to be the poster girl for the MCU's strongest female superhero, I would say that her stand alone movie really paled in comparison to Wonder Woman(2017). While I didn't hate this movie, I feel that it really didn't do much to connect itself to the greater established MCU and really did feel like its own thing that was almost completely disconnected. Furthermore, a lot of the story was told through flash back and the entire plot felt a bit confusing with all the back and forth between the past and present. In addition, I felt that the timing of this movie really wasn't great. This movie came out in March 2019, about a year after Avengers Infinity War but just 2 months before Avengers Endgame, and as a result, most MCU fans were probably more focused on how this movie would connect to the Avengers. When very little connection was made between this movie and the Avengers, it undoubtedly left many fans disappointed. Finally, I really didn't like the character of Captain Marvel and felt that she was really just a static character who wasn't interesting. Compared to other female super heroes like Diana Prince from Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel really didn't stand out as a unique and relatable character. Thus, I will give this move a 3/5. Not terrible but not great either",3
100323,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The movie itself wasn't bad, just wasn't very good. my biggest issue was the lead role actress, just unrelatable and unempthetic to say the least. The finale comes off cringey and unearned, which is a true shame because Marvel has been so consistent with the main character development in past films. The climax of the film has some cool looking scenes and the supporting cast is great but the film does everything it possibly can to make Captain marvel invulnerable, it's hard to relate to her. ",3
100324,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"2.5 starts actually --- Not bad, but definitely one of the weaker MCU film along with Thor 2/Iron Man 2/ Incredible Hulk. Screenplay needed more work and characters feel unfinished. The action scenes are quite ordinary compared to other MCU films. It's advantage was the release time as it came between Infinity War and Endgame, which massively helped its box office success. Brie Larson, Jude Law, Samuel Jackson... all has better films.",3
100325,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I honestly feel like the movie was kinda lame. I think the only reason I saw it was because I thought it would have some kind of connection to the next avengers movie. Not realy though, its mostly just a prequal that answers some questions in a lame way. Most specifically how Nick Furry lost his eye. I was thinking he was gonna loose it in a cool way. But really it was used to set up a joke. Oh well, but I did like the ending fight though. Although if your movie has one really good action scene that can't be too great. Thats just my oppinion anyway. ",3
100326,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"My least favorite of all of the Marvel movies. It was okay, just not great. I think huge fans of the franchise, like me, were disappointed with this movie. If you're not a big fan, but just enjoy the occasional Marvel Superhero Movie, you'll probably enjoy this one too. The lead character never gained my appreciation or sympathy. She also didn't seem to fit into the franchise. Like an afterthought they shoved in at the end just so they could say they had a female in the lead. Personally, I would have much preferred that Marvel took one of the female characters they already got us to love, and made a better movie using her. Oh well, they did a great job on all of the other movies",3
100327,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Captain Marvel is actually, in my opinion, a step down from we except coming from Marvel. It's a little boring and a little predictable and too formulaic. That being said, there are solid laughs in this film and Sam Jackson is, of course, always a win. Definitely worth your time to watch, although waiting till streaming probably wouldn't be the end of the world.",3
100328,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The only reason Marvel would make this is to make the feminists happy. The production and effects are Marvel quality buy the story and acting are not marvel's standard. Fury is a complete opposite of his roles in any other movie. He is a big suck up to Captain Marvel. She acts too cocky and everyone way overestimates her power. They disregard all other lore and brand her as the ""strongest avenger"" when she is not even close. If they want to do a female superhero then do scarlet witch, Valkyrie, or a movie with pepper pots in her new suit tony made. TLDR; the movie is mediocre, they make Captain way more powerful than she really is, acting is only ok, and they really try to push the females are better than males.",3
100329,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The movie's OK. Production is great, direction seems fine, but Brie Larson honestly couldn't have less personality if she tried. Usually Marvel nails their casting but this is a rare miss, she really ruins the movie. Just so bland and one dimensional. Honestly, the writing didn't help her much either. The plot is fun and interesting, but her character doesn't really have any flaws, it's just kinda this whole ""she's a strong female lead so we can't have her say or do anything wrong"" thing. Makes Captain Marvel just this insanely boring, uninteresting character. Honestly, the character herself was just insanely off putting in Endgame as well, so maybe it's not as much Brie Larson's fault, but she definitely doesn't do the role any favors either.",3
100330,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"It was pretty good. I thought that Samuel l Jackson was funny, and so was goose. I think that her character was kinda teetering on the line of good character and sjw propaganda, but that might just be because of Brie Larson’s reputation and the advertisements. Good film, liked the skrulls and stuff, good world building. I hope the sequel fixes the potential Mary-sue problem and makes her character less cocky.",3
100331,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I dislike all the anti-SJW SJWs, but this movie is not good. Nick Fury losing his eye like that = terrible. I'm Just a Girl fight = Super Lame. Brie Larson gives a terrible performance. I saw her do an interview where she said she didn't know how to act like a superhero and it shows in the movie. She does a rage yell where she hangs her tongue out of her mouth. She's puts so much effort into trying to look like a superhero that she comes off as having no emotions even when she is clearly attempting to express emotion. When she gets her powers, she do war whoops while chest bumping through space ships. She is terrible as Captain Marvel. This movie is more than just a terrible stand alone movie. Making her pilot name where Nick Fury gets the name for the Avengers felt forced and making Goose the one that made Fury lose his eye in a movie filled with Skrulls was probably the worst single moment in any Marvel movie. There are some good special effects, but over all, Captain Marvel is a terrible addition to the MCU.",2
100332,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Movie was bland, garbage. The casting choice for captain marvel could have been far better in terms of acting. As for the story choice in the MCU, bad timing. If you are a fan of the comics this movie is a disappointment, visually not as impressive as other marvel movies and not surprised of the visuals. Samuel L Jackson is actually the main character in this film due to screen time and acting compared to Brie Larson. As for those who know nothing of captain marvel in terms of comic references and movies, those who review without understanding the background of the character from both areas of comics and this movie, their review are baseless and the chatter will speak on the behalf of the movie which is not objective but rather subjective. Read the comics to understand the character better then the movie. I feel that this movies production should have been used for another character. Wandavision is something to look too rather then this abomination of a movie.",2
100333,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The visuals were impressive but Brie Larson’s performance and Captain Marvel’s story were lackluster. I rated this with 2 stars because of her bland “acting”, the lack of a character ark and her OP abilities that seem undeserved to the audience. This is coming from a huge fan of the MCU who’s generally easy to please with movies. I’m only writing a review because Brie has publicly blamed men and Hollywood for being sexist due to the film’s relatively mediocre success. I hope the MCU moves on to a better story and gives the spotlight to a better actress.",2
100334,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"When I saw the movie for the 1st time: “I thought it was okay”. It's not the best movie I've seen. The story is confusing most of the time, but has some good laughs. Not much action, but too much talking drama. The Cat or Nick Fury stole the show more than Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel. I liked that this movie took place in the 1990's. Also, Brie Larson, IMO wasn't that great of a choice to play Captain Marvel. Too many chips on her shoulder in the movie. If I would, I could change the movie to make it better. And I would recast a NEW Captain Marvel. Also, I'm concerned about Avengers: Endgame because of this movie... Don't hate on my review (opinion) just because I am a Straight White Male. [Thor > Captain Marvel]  Update: After watching Endgame and Far From Home, this movie still has a bad taste in my mouth. Shazam! & The Rise of Skywalker make this movie look bad. And this movie is no way a milestone movie in any shape or form. And any positive review you see of this movie is one by a SJW, a Liberal or people who don’t watch superhero movies.
",2
100335,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Boring and lacklustre. Asylum movies are far better than this flick. I did not expect such a stupid narrative and boring story telling from marvel. This should have been a DC movie rather than a marvel flick. Anyways sometimes odd things happen just like superb movie like wonder woman from DC( a movie which gave breath to a sinking ship), this will be a black mark for Marvel. I will hope marvel would do something in its sequel to make this character likeable. Thank god she did not had a huge role in endgame.( They should have killed this character in endgame).",2
100336,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Uhhh..... I think this was a little iffy. Because first of all, all of Captain Marvel's flashbacks were just stuck in a weird void of past events. The skrulls were actually the good guys? The trailer deceived me. Most of the time the Kree were just plain old bad guys in question. But GOOSE THE CAT IS SO GODDAMN CUTE!!!!!!!!!!  But on top of all this, I still like DC better.",2
100337,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,This was just boring and underwhelming. I felt like the entire movie was a politically correct ad of “Women and do anything men can do” Capt Marvel (Brie Larson) did not have the flare of Black Widow or Gamora. The action scenes were weak and NOTHING like the fight by the women of Black Panther.... there was just no emotional connection for me. It was felt like a bad date night movie. I did like the Nostalgia back in time feeling. That brought pretty good memories.,2
100338,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Ok this movie was… fine I guess. My main issue is that I just hate captain marvel, she is so annoying. She’s full of herself, acts really rudely and has no character growth. I just don’t like her. Iron man started off in a similar way, being really arrogant and cocky, but he actually had CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and learnt how to be stronger.",2
100339,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"It was a movie that focused too much on shoehorning their female lead into being some strong unstoppable force, for the sake of making a role model of little girls, instead of actually writing a good character or movie. This shoehorning of ideals in place of creating an actual good movie not only ruins the movie, but it also muddles the message as the movie is the medium that the message is being displayed through. I'm fine with people having political/ethical messages in movies, but when you sacrifice the quality of the movie to do so, I might as well watch a 10 minute propaganda piece and not waste my time.",2
100340,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The movie is not bad, because production-wise is great alas when you have a weak character and poor character building your movie will feel like a waste of time. There is no hero journey here, there is no character growth. She basically at the end of the movie figures out that she was all mighty all along and that men were keeping her down. So she learns nothing and when your character is already all-powerful, if there are no struggles, you cant really connect to this. Only entitle people will connect with this hero.",2
100341,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"I'm sorry but this movie was complete utter Trash to me, Yeah it made a million dollars but that's because it was Sandwiched in between, Infinity war & Endgame, This movie could of been a legend but they had to get political, and Demonize anybody that didn't like the film, And have Cringe worthy Scenes of men being evil and Persecute her because her gender, I'm sorry that's not inspiring it's cringy Cancer And makes me want to Jump off A building and end it all. Why do we need this Bs in female lead movies women are Not all helpless victims they are people with Bright futures & Oppurtunities, Captain marvel as a Charecter is terrible she's unlikable & annoying. Oh how black widow was wronged she should of gotten a movie first, this movie was lame & forgettable sad very sad all the talk about Female Empowerment & Feminism this movie will be forgotten In someone's mind in just a day. I'm looking forward to black widow the heroine we actually deserve & is a Complex Flawed Interesting Charecter. Something Captain marvel failed at.",1
100342,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Yo, everyone saying this movie is ""great"" falls under one of two categories. #1. Lesbian Separatists - these are women who believe men are worse and like to see women be placed on top of men... basically saying they don't like movies with men. #2 Die Hard Superman Fans - these aren't your true superman fans, these are the ones who don't care if superman has a deep back story, basically they like any action movie with a superhero and were thrilled to have a female lead for once. Now, down to why is movie is even worse than The Incredible Hulk. Captain Marvel doesn't even qualify as a hero, she's selfish, egotistic, overpowered, and lacks any character. When the greatest supervillain in the entire marvel universe was attacking Earth for the first time, her excuse for not being there was that every planet has it just as bad. HOW??? Thanos is confirmed to be the greatest threat in the universe, so how were all other planets having it just as bad, LAME EXCUSE. Anyways, it's okay to like the movie, but it's just sooo overrated, she just doesn't have any qualities that a superhero needs, which is why I wish Marvel released Black Widow before Captain Marvel so it would have a more fair rating.",1
100343,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"This was the most disappointing and not good marvel movie ever! They really did a lazy job on making this movie. Brie Larson was bad in this movie and a really weird voice actor and deserved not to be in ENDGAME!!! It does not make any sense at all! Brie Larson gave people some ill advice. ALSO WHY IS DOES HER NAME HAVE MARVEL IN IT, It should had been something else like caption LADY as a more better name 😕🙁😶😑😐. I liked All the other standalone avengers movies, That also includes IRON MAN 2,3 THOR :THE DARK WORLD, AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK. they were all good and entertaining. The others are good, epic, awesome and perfect,  but I LOAD THIS ONE SO MUCHHH!!!! Nick furry, the cat goose and the villain were the only good characters in the movie, but everyone else is just HORRENDOUS. I would rather watch Shrek the third, Despicable Me 3, Ice age Collision Course, The lego Movie 2: The Second Part ( don’t like that movie 😢) Cars 2 and Transformers 2,4 and 5 cause those are better movies.  If I would choose Captain Marvel or kidney stone. I would pick...
",1
100344,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"The worst Marvel movie in existence. The writers behind this movie must have been working in a facility with a gas leak because the script makes zero sense. ""An explosion that causes millennials to become the most powerful beings in the universe"" if this concept was true wouldn't all of the people who were present during nuclear blasts be super heroes? Bad casting, lack luster dialogue, horrendous story. There was an especially awful scene of our hero in a dream state as Nirvana plays on vinyl to relax her and remind her of her childhood... maybe find a lead actress who was born before the grunge period ended? A major flop from our favorite super hero film makers.",1
100345,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Actually I think this movie is so boring. Captain marvel tries to be cool girl which make it even worse. The graphics are pretty impressive  and the editing too. But apart from that its not worth watching.

100346,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"Very Bad plot, 2nd no game I mean the character is wayyy powerful and somehow not so great acting too... and I specifically don't like the character built, feels like she's not trustworthy and very stubborn. She acts like a child in many scenes, and she kills all of the armies ( like 50k people) and lets the boss just go... like what? You'll be fine without this movie there's nothing important in here to the MCU just the character so it's safe to pass this and watch the others...",1
100347,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,"This review is not as much about the movie being a 1.  I would really put it as a 2.  However, anytime someone tells me something is amazing but I do not agree it pushes me to think it is even worse.  The same is true when I think a movie is good and other people say it is trash, it pushes me to like it more.  I should work on being less of a contrarian.",1
100348,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,This is the worst Marvel film and I can't believe they are making another. I hope they write her off or something. This character just feels like a after thought. The story was boring...sorry to say...trash 🗑️. They did Scarlet Johansen wrong by putting this movie out before her.,1
100349,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,Aside from all the political BS this movie is just plain bad. It's has none of the character of the earlier Marvel movies and just feels cold and lifeless. Yes the special effects are good but so what? What about the story? Captain Marvel makes no sense at all. I genuinely like the Marvel universe but I've a feeling it will all be downhill from now on.,1
100350,Captain Marvel,2019,Action/Sci-fi,At least Brie Larson was ok as a side character in Scott Pilgrim.  The movie was lackluster in all regards and was for the most part a waste of money.  The only redeeming feature this movie had was that I was able to fall asleep and dream of other good movie that I could have actually spent money on and enjoyed.  I would give less if I could but that would be more effort than the writers gave to this movie.,1
100351,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Black Panther was an outstanding and gorgeous film. Complete with unquestionable talent, beautiful visuals, and immersive and fun music. Chadwick Boseman, Rest In Peace, gave his all and played T’Challa with vigor and style. He brought us an interesting and fan-favorite character. His co-stars all played there parts to perfection. Michael B Jordan played one of the most convincing and heartfelt villains of the MCU. Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira were amazing as T’Challa’s partners in crime throughout the movie. And Letitia Wright played a convincing role as Shuri and created a chemistry between her character and her brother that was loved by many. And there are so many more great Talents in this movie who did the movie good. The visuals and action of the movie were unprecedented and were sure to leave a mark in our memories. The music was notable as immersive with an African vibe and fun feel. An overall outstanding movie that I would highly recommend to watch.",5
100352,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I love this movie I already gave a review of this before but it was pretty short and watching it again made me like it a lot more so here we go. black panther is a great film with a good message and a surprisingly good villain Erik killmonger who ou can actually take his side for some of the things he is saying. I think this movie is great because there were a lot of people who watched this movie and loved it even if they hadn't watched other movies in the MCU you can appreciate this as a movie, not just another MCU movie because it's less about setting up future movies and more about giving a message and introducing some great characters. it was so sad to hear that Chadwick Boseman died and watching this again made it hit harder for me Chadwick does a great job as black panther who is one of the cooler and different characters in marvel and it was so cool that he got his own movie this is my second favorite MCU movie and I really enjoyed it because of its great story, message, action and characters",5
100353,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"One of the best MCU ever made. The excellence of this film and the black excellence of this film. The casting was spot on. No one else can be T Challa but Chadwick Bosemen. He brings an effortless coolness and calming but will get the job done nature to being king. Michael b Jordan casting was on point his sister, the rival tribe leader, Mrs Bassett. I’m proud of Ryan Coogler but I am most proud of Kevin Feige and Marvel studios for seeing the value in this art. African Americans can carry big budgets as well. Kendrick Lamar doing the soundtrack was genius. Costume design, pride just w surging about this movie was and is flawless. The women warriors and all done with such grace and balance. The story, plot, theme, score everything amazing.",5
100354,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Extremely well written with the most realistic and exciting special affects but the cast of actors are extraordinary.  This movie is by far the best of the Marvel universe and DC Comics as well. Of course Stan Lee will Grace us with a cameo appearance.  Love the movie and I recommend it highly.  They’ve managed to capture action, comedy, and realistic vibes between the Black Panther and his love interest, his security, his Kingdom and most of all, his sister.  Andy Serkis was a fun loving, maniacal, villain. Danai Gurira was the the kind of security/friend everyone would love to have.  Letitia Wright was the perfect, brilliant and funny little sister. Lupita is the ideal love interest…strong willed and beautiful. Chadwick Boseman appears to be born of Royal blood and he’s absolutely perfect for the part. Angela Bassett is the ideal Queen Mother. Michael B. Jordan is a mystery filled with intrigue… perfect adversary.",5
100355,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Right now, revisiting this film feels like watching The Crow, because despite the lead being a young and seemingly healthy individual, you know that a tragic death is nigh for them...but this film is far more then a grim curiosity. This was and still is a ground-breaking piece of cinema that proves that Africa can be an interesting place to explore cinematically. Much like Blade before him, this film goes above beyond to show that black superheroes are just as powerful and cool as white ones. The writing is spot on, the research done by the crew for the movie is beyond comprehensive and the story is heartfelt and full of memorable characters. Chadwick Boseman is the star, but Letitia Wright, Lupita N'Yongo, Angela Bassett and Micheal B Jordan deserve their dues. As does the music, the costumes and the director, Ryan Coogler. The only down side is some dopey looking CGI but no film is perfect I guess.",5
100356,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I thing that it is one of the best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe. After Chadwick Sir. died I watched this film again and in second time it felt this movie more and more amazing. From my point of view this is that kind of movie that will entertain you again and again, doesn't matter how many times you're watching it. From my point of view Killmonger was not wrong. Of course as a child he saw his father died in the hands of his own uncle T'Chaka and it was very difficult time for him. He also was criticised because of his colour, because when he arrived to Sakanya he said, "" There are more than 2 billion people in this world like us, and you don't cares about them"". That leaves a great message. I liked The fight of Aananda, the process of making a king, the fight vision of Black Panther in this film, chasing Andy Sarkies, history of Wakanda, climax, Killmonger's death( Well, that was the most emotional scene ever), when Vibration was stollen from the museum, when T'Challa went to the soul world and met his father, when Killmonger went to thr soul world to meet his father, when T'Challa returned from Coma, Killmonger vs T'Challa for the throne, Killmonger vs T'Challa after he returned, the new Vibranium suit of Black Panther rtc. Black Panther film is the reason we all fell in love with this charecter and ofcourse Late. Chadwick Boseman, One of the greatest actor hollywood ever found. I also liked the mid credit scene, in we which Wakanda is no longer a hidden place, and I was shocked when I saw Bucky in the post credit scene as well as Martian Freeman and Andy Sarkies in this film. R.I.P Chadwick Boesman, WAKANDA FOREVER.",5
100357,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Addressing hope for reconciliation, BLACK PANTHER picturizes how to avoid, thwart and prevent evil through sharing and coordination of technology with good leaders. In the dangerous world in which we live, superhero movies with heroes with good moral character, integrity, and self-sacrifice are popular partly because audiences want to see heroes who enable good to prevail over evil. This movie is rated PG-13, due to the violent struggles between good and evil. It is appropriate for middle schoolers-adults. Where the earlier American Black Panther group used power for militancy, this latest Black Panther uses technology and power for the Good of All. At the 2019 Oscar Awards this movie was honored with nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound Mixing.

From the cast to the costumes, the plot to the props, and the magnificent special effects, this movie had me so engulfed I found myself on the edge of my seat during the entire movie!!",5
100361,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I revisited the film in 2021 for the first time since seeing it in theaters twice in 2018 I have to say that the film is bogged down by its third act. A third act was hampered by a terrible CGI fight with poor lighting and indistinguishable combatants. The more practical stunts apart of the daytime Warrior Falls sequences were probably the height of the action which there actually was little of it in the film. Hopefully, they will improve on this in the upcoming sequel balancing the compelling story and cultural elements with better action that doesn't devolve into a CGI-heavy slugfest by the end.",4
100362,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Good movie.  I don't agree with 96% on rotten tomatoes at all.  Critics are a joke.  Audience score is 79%, which is much more fitting. The only reason it is rated that high is because of the race factor of the movie.  When you look beyond that, you'll see it isn't the masterpiece everyone thinks it is.  That's not to say it isn't enjoyable, with certain aspects like the action and music.  The villain is very well-written thankfully.  At times the cgi can be crappy, and the final battle is relatively disappointing.  82/100",4
100363,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Black Panther was a quality film. It had a lot of flair, a good cast, and a fire soundtrack. I did however, find it to be a bit bland just from the lack of more interesting developments. The villain was fine, he had a good backstory and was understandably pissed. He wasn't as interesting as Loki, Hela, or Thanos but, was fine. Overall, a cool addition to the MCU.",4
100364,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,It is a really good movie. All the characters are perfect and even the villain is the best.  I rate it 4/5. Must watch and this movie made me love black panther even more. Now black panther is my favourite Mcu character.,4
100365,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Black Panther itself a different superhero film with new ideas never explored before. It is having a great villain, hero, director, characters, story, performances, visual effects (except in most of the time) and you name it. It's my second best influential superhero film right after The Dark Knight.",4
100366,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Really enjoyed this movie yes it’s predictable from the start but still really good and definitely worth a watch. First film I seen Chadwick Boseman in can’t believe he’s dead now too young RIP,4
100367,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,I love the racial movement that is involved in this movie. The villain is great and I love the setting and concept of the film. Only a couple problems here. 1. Bad visuals like cgi and other effects. 2. Rip off of lion king,4
100368,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Pretty good movie from the MCU. I love Killmonger so much. That guy's character is wow. Sadly Zuri died terribly.,4
100369,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Black panther is more then a masterpiece it’s well crafted and very enjoyable for a comic book fan and a normal veiwer overall it’s a great directed movie but the execution is the ok cgi and not great fight scenes overall everyone was good in this movie Wakanda forever,4
100370,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"We really missing the great hero Chadda , may his soul RIP, Black Panther, it thrills every second, such a great nail biting movie leaves you to sit edge of the seat..must watch.",4
100371,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"...oh such spectacular beginnings, great style...exotic language graphics, translated to English  (or whatever language  perhaps ? ) an intriguing concept  of a high tech futuristic hidden world in Africa...vs intrinsic and ancestral excellent photographic  design, costume design, ...a sense of extraordinary mystique  and destiny ... a few wonderful character introductions.... and fabulous actors also ....and then interesting in terms of being true stylistically and so on to marvel comics and original scenarios... but nevertheless seemingly promising truly amazing  character developments after first 10 to 15 minutes of introduction care of  wonderful character actors ....which story  never seemed to materialize ..( it would appear to those such as myself who have had very limited experience with marvel comics and superheroes ...except for maybe a few brief glances at such material.) So anyway... I dropped out somewhat disappointed or disinterested ....about halfway through the film....I guess I was  hoping for some great new revelation  or discovery .. or insight ?  Or did I just give up too soon ...? It sure looked promising... anyway... so please try again....please  ? ! Or tell me what I missed..... !  Best wishes  !.... and great appreciation for your efforts  ...thus far...truly ! (It was an amazing beginning at least ... and so.. thank you .... for that !  ) maybe it was me who just faded out... don't know.....",3
100372,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"There's a lot to like about the film. Was it Oscar winning? Not really, but politics aside it's an important film and not just within the superhero genre. I enjoyed the film overall with a few reservations. I'm not sure why some people believe it's a racist movie because of the black to white ratio of actors though, a point that some people seem to be uneasy with (does that really make any film less enjoyable?). Thought it was a refreshing change in fact, and performances were generally very good with a focus on strong positive female roles. What I didn't like was the over reliance on cgi (that it wasn't all that good), and the film seemed very self indulgent stretching out the storyline unnecessarily into 2 hours and 15 minutes. So despite my decreasing interest in the multitude of superhero films that are being churned out this is far from the worst. A solid 7/10.",3
100373,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"They made Killmonger a sympathetic villain and this makes me hate him but I must admit Michael B Jordan's performance is good. This movie overall is very overrated. People only like it because it has ""black people in it"" and ""it shows justice to them"". Don't get me wrong I have nothing against them. The jokes were pretty funny especially that meme ""What are those???"". The special effects are decent but that final battle looked like a PS2 game. The car chase is probably one of the best moments in the whole movie. Story is quite interesting but there are movies out there that are a lot better. I won't say that this is childish because it has some scary scenes like 3 deaths. You don't really have to watch this to be honest because I found it kind of boring.",3
100374,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Movie was ok. Meh at best. I think its weird that there are bots on here literally copying and pasting the same exact comments and google has done nothing to erase them. Very dishonest reviews. As far as the movie to me it was ok. A lot of stuff didn't make sense. So its a No for me. Chadwick was not the problem for this film. The writing was. Outside of a few punch lines, I personally liked Boseman in Civil War better than I liked him in his own movie.",3
100375,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"This film is decent. It is a good way to officially introduce T'Challa into the MCU. My only problem with this movie is the fans. This film is vastly overrated, and I have been called racist for saying that. Also, the day after it came out, spoilers were completely unavoidable because everyone was busy crapping themselves over this movie. Anyway, it isn't the best origin movie, but it is ok.",3
100376,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"There’s a lot to like about this film, but I pretty much checked out when — (spoiler) — the guy who was broken from a lifetime in social services came to inherently epitomize raw evil. He was the most empathetic and relatable character, given the rest was (obviously) fantasy, so it made no sense that we would be expected to appreciate him as the antagonist in this film.",3
100377,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Im not into sci fi I thought it was a different Black Panther. It does depict Africa quite well everyone fighting everyone. Friends are enemies. Africa needs to do some inner healing the money other countrys give causes war. DONT GIVE MONEY. Africa needs help but dont send money thats what causes the problems send education or teachers or Martyrs who dont mind dying. If the Chinese can work it out let them,",3
100378,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"The movie was bland and didn't stick out to me at all. I don't care about the representation, a movie should not be reviewed based on the race of the cast/production team. Black Panther is an agonizingly boring movie, and after having it hyped up by reviewers before I went to see it, it stings even more. It's not as funny as the Spider Mans or Infinity War, it isn't at all important to the plot of the MCU, the story in a vacuum is alright but nothing extraordinary, and this review is 2 years late so who cares?",3
100379,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"The movie is ok, the acting is subpar but the character are quite bad. The movie was mostly made for more black representation in the MCU witch I'm not mad about I just think it shouldn't have been done differently. Chadwick Boseman's acting was horrible, and Ta Chall is a character not worth routing for. Also Michael B. Jordan's character is weak, and the acting is bad. One of the driving forces of Killmonger wad that black people where slaves, but Africa had and currently dose have slaves.",3
100380,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I enjoyed some of the movie, but it’s far from my favorite movie. I can see why It didn’t get the best picture award. Yet, I understand how great the intentions were, and they were successful on many levels. Very nice try.",3
100381,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"It’s a shame it was meant to be about a marvel superhero, because it  really struggled to stay tethered to marvel universe and the main character struggled to be a hero. Unless being revived from a coma is his superpower. They tried too hard to make a film that was all things to all people... great acting and effects. Great  standalone movie... just don’t get too excited about it if you are an MCU fan.",2
100382,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,one of the worst freaking mcu movies i ever had the privilege to watch. chadwick boseman or however you spell his name was the ONLY good thing about it. he was a treasure and an outstanding actor doing amazing by the script he had. i think the movie was just overall boring,2
100383,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Black Panther is an OK marvel movie, which is saying a lot. It is nothing special and overrated because of political correctness and themes of race. It is by far even close to the top 5 marvel movies. Sadly, people rate the movie based on political agenda rather than the content.",2
100384,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Too boring. Acting was very political and stereotypical for our moment in time. Where everything is anti-trump but we're going to obviously use Trump's Wall though. Yeah that's OK. As long as its for non-whites. I think this could've been awesome minus the leftist politics.,2
100385,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Rest in peace Chadwick. Regardless of Chadwick's sad passing, I think Black Panther is a bad movie. The acting of the villains and some characters isn't very good. The CGI fight at the end is bad and the villain is fine. He shouldn't have underacted and he shouldn't just have the same suit but more boring. The costume design is incredible and the humor isn't bad. Regardless I think the movie is mediocre.",2
100386,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Didn't love this movie (I am not racist) because of the story. But loved the performance of the actors, especially Chadwick. Love you, Chadwick Boseman. We miss you.",2
100387,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I was really excited to watch this movie after all the hype and it's release in 2018, however after trying to watch the movie to completion a second time, I didn't find it as captivating as other super hero movies like Superman: Man Of Steel or X-Men: First Class.  In all honesty I think it's time for movie directors to jump off the Superhero bandwagon now and come up with more captivating movies.",2
100388,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"It was ok. WAAAAAY overhyped. Idk. Before you shoot me and say I'm ""just racist"", I honestly didnt have a problem with the mostly black cast, it was the weak plot and way overhyped story in general. It wasn't a masterpiece but had some good special effects and stuff...",2
100389,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Have waited a long time for this film to be available to rent at an affordable price. So disappointed. A predictable, rehashed storyline. Acting so so. And the mish mash of random African cultures? They seemed to be just for set dressing.",2
100390,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,This film is overrated and the same as every other super hero movie that they continue to make.  Sadly I had hopes that this one was different but it was misplaced.  The villain was not believable and the idea of an advanced civilization adhering to ancient customs is ridiculous. Marvel continues to dissapoint,2
100391,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I would give this movie negative stars if I could. Words cannot accurately describe my hatred for this movie. It has too many flaws for me to cover in one review, the acting, plot holes, and the God awful visuals. The film feels like it's trying far too hard to be relevant and make political statements, and Marvel's horrible jokes take a front row seat here. Shuri is the single worst character in any film i have ever seen. If you think Killmonger was a good villian, time to rethink your right to critisize movies.  Absolute garbage, save as many braincells as you can and skip on this atrocity.",1
100392,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,boring. The pacing is awful and the fact that tchalla is basically immortal with the panther suit releases all tension. Killmonger is cool but thats about it. His motives are clear but the execution makes it seem as if hes another random bad guy. The movie even dares to make the viewer think that tchalla dies. Forest Whitaker's character dies but since we know nothing about the character there is no weight to the scene besides tchallas reaction.  The blinded praise for this movie is the only thing holding it up.,1
100393,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Awful movie. First half was unwatchable. Premise was laughable. Horrible storytelling. Awful characters. Terrible protagonist & antagonist. Bad CGI & special effects. Bad acting.,1
100394,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Gave me a headache from all the action noise🤕...some of the worse acting I’ve seen 🙄...not sure how it was even nominated?! 1 white guy in  the whole cast 😆😆😆...like why even bother 🤔,1
100395,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,Terrible movie. Wasnt about panthers or the political group of the 60’s. Also strange how a bunch of the last 5 star reviews for this movie are the exact same 🤔,1
100396,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"I think this film is a complete waste of my time and I highly recommend that nobody watches this film at all costs!! Very disappointed marvel, do better next time.",1
100397,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,He is making me struggle on my human geography project... No diffusion found in this movie which cost me 5 points in my project which would put me at a 80 percent,1
100398,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,If I could give it no stars I would immediately because this movie is very racist towards White People and is mentioned several times through out this movie which ruined it for me!! X-(,1
100399,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"This movie has horrible writing, bad cgi, average acting, poor jokes, ok editing and average pacing the movie always turns when it could go in a good or interesting direction",1
100400,Black Panther,2018,Action/Adventure,"Marvel marketed this as first black superhero movie. Well, I have brain and I saw 'Blade'. But still, this movie is boring and without logic.",1
100401,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"I like how it is transitions after the emotional events of CA:Civil War, It gives new hope and a place for new characters. It shows how Marvel Studios can create a superhero that in different and unique way that exceeded their own limits. And the character, ugh SO AMAZING.",5
100402,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"Doctor Strange is an amazing movie, Marvel's Doctor Strange had that elegancy, nicely directed by Derrickson, magical portals by Sorcerer Supreme, graphics, done well. How he defeats Dormammu and Kaecillius. With a touch of intensity, I give it 5 stars. Hats-Off to the director and the screenwriter screenwriters.",5
100403,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"I 100% recommend this movie. I have trouble finding the words to describe it. Now I might not let some children watch it because there are some gory parts, but that is a decision others can make. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do.",5
100404,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,I love to watch this movie and it is very fun to watch. I usually hate watching movies more than once but the storyline and visual effects of this movie are spectacular! I really encourage you to watch this!,5
100405,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"A film towards infinity and beyond, the male Benedict Cumberbatch is so immersed in his role that you will feel the imagination for a moment, no matter how logical. This masterpiece will not be forgotten in our minds.",5
100406,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,This movie is an underrated hidden gem! This movie had spectacular visuals and awesome acting. Marvel did it well! I honestly can’t wait for the sequel!,5
100407,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"My absolute favourite Marvel movie, watched it 6 times and it's still not enough, I've readed every single comic book regarding Doctor Strange and I personally feel like it's the absolute best character Marvel could offer, on par with Constantine from DC imo",5
100408,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,very good movie with its spectacular visual effect. Mr. Benedict is charming actor bring charisma to the character! can't wait for the next movie!,5
100409,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"This movie is great on so many levels like its amazing visuals, a great lead in Benedict Cumberbatch and good supporting cast and a good villain. underrated and can’t wait for the sequel",5
100410,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,AWesomeeee movie!!!!! Watching Strange work through his struggles not only physically but mentally created such a hooked and amazing plot!!! 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D,5
100411,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"This one of my favourite movies, and I have watched a lot of masterpieces, its not that I have watched only generic movies so ofcourse I will find it good, No. I watched TDK triology, all Chris nolan movies, all marvel movies but this stands out because I like the arrogant characters, I love the visual effects like this, I am not a fan of action, but visual effects like this, buildings getting round, mirror dimension etc, I love these types of visual effects. But the thing that I find bad about it is its runtime, its only 1 hour 57 mins and thats why movie feels like rushed, first dr strange is a normal person, very arrogant, best in the buisness, then gets into an accident, gets lost, tries to find a way out, then finds a man who got cured from a condition like him, finds kamar taj, gets in it, starts training, especially this part is very very rushed, learns everything, then kamar taj gets attacked and he reunites with cristine, oh did I forget, yes their is a chemistry between cristine palmer and strange, its really amazing but gets extremely low screen time, like I wanted a lot lot more,but it got only few minutes, then dr strange fights the people who are best in the buisness of magic, defeats them, anicient one dies, Omg thats too much in 2 hours, then reverses time and wins. And there's a lot I missed like his chemistry with wong and that other Black friend.",4
100412,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"I thought this was pretty good. However, after the Avengers: infinity wars disney got super liberal. Anyway , I'm never gonna go see another marvel movie if all the characters are now suddenly ""different"". I bet Stan Lee would love to see his life achievements and his beloved characters stepped on because someone complained. ""Someones feeling will get hurt"" says the generation that laughed at family guy. Feels like I'm living in russia;)",4
100413,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"This movie was one of my favorites, although I say that about every Marvel movie I watch. I think that Dr. Strange is one of the movies that are less dramatic, less action is involved. All in all, it's still a pretty great movie, and I really suggest watching it. I give it a 4 star because a little more action would be better, it feels like the movie isn't complete without a bigger fight, and thats not typical marvel style to not make it so un dramatic.",4
100414,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"great storyline, perfect mix of dark & hillarious. though i can really appreciate creativity & magic in this, ive never been a fan of multiverse theories where theres like 50 different versions of you. it just seems like a bit overkill and unnecessary plot-wise. but also to be frank, immoral.  if you think cloning human bodies are immoral...then it should be like 10x worse to clone an actual soul.  When you really think about it, it becomes VERY depressing. it would make what makes you you essentially meaningless, because you don't  even own your entire soul....its split up countless times in countless different bodies in countless different universes. your whole existence becomes pointless.",4
100415,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"It's definitely not the best Marvel film, but Benedict just works so well for Doctor Strange and the visuals were absolutely marvellous. There were some nice quippy bits that made it fun as well. Great casting and visuals. It could be more interesting but it's a quality film overall.",4
100416,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"i liked the part where dr. strange was at the ER and gandalf came and said ""help i lost my avacado!!!!!!!"" and then his eyes imploded and he turned into a racoon. and then pikachu came and ate racoon gandalf and said "" i wish i could have a cucumber plane"" then he flew into the sun and became the god of bananas and then he sent down a super lazer with high pressured cheese infused in it. and on the other side of the world james bond killed shrek but then he noticed he had left his killing license  in the car and then the FBI ate him. but it pretty good.
",4
100417,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"An amazing film. The powers and the screenplay was extraordinary. There could be some extra scenes about some characters, like the ancient-one. There could also be some Scenes about the magic and how it works and some sci-fi stuff. Scott derrickson has done a good gob.",4
100418,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,very good one... I am impressed. The FX are unexpected and really neat and well cared. It's a real artwork. I just didn't like the humor formula. It kind of lessen the impact of a serious sci movie. Not sure. Other than that great actors and story.,4
100419,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"This 2016 movie shows a lot of passion towards a neurosurgeon whose life changes after an accident. The film also spends some minutes of it in a hospital, so I definitely recommend it for doctors and nurses.",4
100420,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,A brilliant surgeon is forced to re-assess his life. He learns the price of salvation is high and that each step towards his ambition brings him closer to a fate more dreadful and more glorious than he could have imagined. Here be Wizards.,4
100421,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Not great. But its good in some ways. Here's the bad: Stupid unfunny jokes. Why do all the superheroes have to try to be funny??? Just annoys me. Also the CGI of DORMAMMU looked and felt too much like The Green Lantern movies bad guy's. Just very bad very bad. This movie lacked a real bad guy presence. It felt lazy. It actually took me a lot of time to like this Doctor Strange. But I ended up liking it a little enough to give it a chance. To atleast if nothing else link the MARVEL UNIVERSE together in new ways. So if you didn't see this movie. Its ok you don't need to its just back story fluff.,3
100422,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Ok so yesh. And before I start I respect the actors in every way I just felt the story was boring. Doctor Strange is just if Iron man and Harry Potter had a child. If you compare the two their exactly the same!!! The effects were awesome though. Sadly the story was boring. It felt bland and lacked action. I also feel like it wasn’t that important for the story or it doesn’t fit well. They really did this just to tell us about the time stone. Overall it just was bland and boring. I would only watch this just for the time stone part but otherwise no.,3
100423,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Felt like a bunch of sci-fi references put together in a magic fantasy story. They didn't tell certain things well. Still an entertaining action superhero movie and a strong origin story for Doctor Strange.,3
100424,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"Its draws emphasis on the life beyond the human view. It seems delusional, but, possesses some epitome of reality.",3
100425,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,The only reason why the movie lacks two star is it's road action scenes that are very repeatable 😞,3
100426,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"I didn't like it as much as as other Marvel movies but it was still pretty good, not one of my favorites though.",3
100427,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,average at best. for a 2 hour long movie it was sooooooooooo anoyyyyyyyying,3
100428,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"Visually Incredible, hard to pronounce name, worth the watch",3
100429,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Back ground music is to loud and drowns out the dialogue.,3
100430,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Well its not jack could have been scarier,3
100431,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"You are about to watch a hyper-fictional movie with literally nothing makes sense. They'll tell you about parallel universes and spiritual dimensions, which are as unreasonable asf. The flow is too fast: a doctor becomes a great magician in a couple of months, reading some books and doing tricks that would take others years to master. When you watch a fiction movie, you are waiting for a good plot to hide the fact that the movie is fiction. Doctor Strange just exposes it out. ",2
100432,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,the story was just all over the place and the story was kinda boring it felt like they did not even show us how he escaped the Antarctic and  it felt like he just read some books and then stole the time stone and did a master spell after a few weeks of training and the presence of the bad guy was nowhere until the end and the big fight wasn't even exiting because what he did is just die over and over agin and used the time stone without even knowing what he was using and they need more background story and it's kinda weird that he would spend so much money trying to use his hands after seeing him use them perfectly in multiple sences,2
100433,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Dr Strange is a good character but the film itself is kind of boring. It didn't hold my attention and I felt like dormammu was good but the events leading up to it just weren't very interesting.,2
100434,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,The movie was very good but in my opinion I did not like it simply because I do not like the character but the actor was great!,2
100435,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"disappointing movie,feels like iron man with magic hopefully the sequel is better",2
100436,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,A long acid trip. I found the story confusing.,2
100437,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,This movie is truly boring. Spider man is way better than Dr. Strange. My favorite Marvel movie is Spider Man Homecoming. Spider man is a really awesome superhero and Dr. Strange is a piece of garbage.,1
100438,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,This is the worst of the MCU by a mile. The villains are so lame they barely make any impact on anything. It's just a dumpster fire of a movie.,1
100439,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,"After the first half I just wanted to leave the theatre. The visuals, the characters, the jokes, the story- everything about this movie was quite off putting.",1
100440,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Bad Movie. left within the first 15 mins went to eat mc donalds with bff Kelsie poopikins,1
100441,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,This is may be Great movie for sci-fi lovers,1

100449,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Dr.strange is Nice & amazing :),4
100450,Doctor Strange,2016,Action/Adventure,Great movie just wished I watched it in 2016 not 2018,4
100451,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This movie was fantastic! The camera work was incredible and never boring to watch. Visually, it was a masterpiece of color and energy. The action was the best we have had in the MCU since Spiderman took out Mysterio's drones. The final fight scene finally escaped the trope of the villain and hero having the exact same power, which was what I was expecting from the trailer going into the movie. The movie also did such an incredible job splicing in backstory at just the right moment that it was engaging and made the characters more interesting instead of distracting from the plot. There are some criticisms I have of the movie, such as the reliance on the trope of a perfectly peaceful society that gets attacked as a backstory/setting, the trope of killing off the villain right when he is at the point of redemption and could have an interesting character arc, and finally just the way that some of the jokes fell flat. But as a whole, this is undeniably the most unique and creative movie to be made this year, and it was incredible to get to watch it in theaters with the full super hero experience!",5
100452,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The movie is both a beautiful homage to classic martial arts movies AND a wonderful story of love, loss, grief, and the bonds between parents and their children and how they can warp and break.  The acting is impeccable top to bottom, Simu Liu is a STAR (seriously, what can't the guy do?! I saw a video on Twitter of him playing guitar and singing beautifully, too) and Awkwafina and Tony Leung TRULY shine as well.  My only tiny quibble was a couple of the cgi effects looked a little rubber band-ish a couple times, like when a body flies across the screen or things like that. This quibble is not enough to get me to knock my review down from 5 stars though.  An absolutely epic movie.  A triumph.  Must-see, in theaters.",5
100453,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Marvel is back, dear. Today I watched Shang - Chi. It was so amazing. I really like that MCU is getting diverse day by day. The Fighting scenes were really awesome and well cinematographed. You will get a complete feel of thrilling martial arts with the vibe of Marvel. One thing I loved the most was Shang-chi alone was not able to defeat the villains. Other characters also played an important role in his success. All characters contributed their best to create a good storyline. The storyline was simple but fresh. The cast crew was fine (the actors were awesome). MCU movies are always a great mixture of Drama, Actions, Humor, and fantasies. And being an MCU movie Shang- Chi is full of these factors. Dear Marvel fans, make sure that you should watch this movie. An introduction of a new superhero in our MCU world.",5
100454,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"One of the best marvel movies I've ever seen. The acting was well done, fight scenes were breathtaking and the story while predictable was still enjoyable to watch. The best part is that this movie could very well stand on its own and still be great. What I also enjoy was the lack of a romantic story line with the main protagonist. It let the story focus on what was happening and made it feel more urgent and could move at a faster pace. I don't think there was ever a lag in the movie but it also isn't as long as a normal marvel movie. It also has that classic marvel comedy. each of the main characters had growth and played an important role in the development of the story. Marvel keeps leveling up what female characters can do and become. Stong, funny, dynamic, determined and human. This is a great start to the next phase. Will be seeing it again!",5
100455,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The fight scenes are amazing (I especially love the bus scene near the beginning), the performances of the actors are great, the cinematography is good, the story is well-told, I really like the world of Ta Lo, and I like how the bad father character’s main motivation isn’t to conquer or destroy the world. Also, while this movie has connections to the MCU, it could function as its own separate thing, which is GREAT. This is one of my favourite Marvel films. My small criticism is that the British comic relief character (from the MCU film “Iron Man 3”) feels tedious and unnecessary — I seriously don’t know why he’s in the movie other than to provide some laughs, but he definitely does that.",5
100456,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,This was an amazing movie the action was amazing there was only one scene where it is so cgi but that was only for 2 seconds so you can't really tell. but the end credit scene's yes there are 2 of them they are so amazing and in the first one I could barley breathe I was in shock. this movie was so cool oh and when I found out about how there was 2 end credit scene's a few people went right back to there seat's. but WOW this was amazing cool and yes watch it now especially if your a marvel fan. but at first when I watched the trailer a few month's ago I did't care about the movie but because it was marvel might as well watch it but last month I started watching more trailers and looking at stuff about shang-chi and then I was like I need to watch this so I just finished it and I loved it.,5
100457,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Shang Chi is one of the best MCU Films! Guys, I watched it on Disney+Hostar and I can say it was a experience which I missed. This movie is a movie which will be enjoyed on big screens! but I was not able to go. So anyways let us start, no spoilers:- this movie has great action, story, screenplay, performances and VFX. The story is simple, screenplay is fast paced and fully thrilling! no bad adult scenes. You can watch with your family. This movie is meant for family! Action is superfast and enjoyable! gives nostalgia of Jackie Chan! everybody did great acting. Movie has extraordinary vfx and direction. This story-telling way is very good! I am not bluffing! Fights, emotions, jokes and one-liners are also enjoyable! you will really enjoy it even as a non-mcu fan. Thanks for reading.",5
100458,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"OMG! This movie is awesome every single effect and fighting was more than excellent in the last when he calls his ring back after throwing them in the dragon stomach o my god opppppp. For this movie the rating should be till ten and would have given it 10/10. Plz make sure to watch the picture on Disney plus. Marvel I will say that ( Chang-chi the legends of ten rings you did an excellent work ( more than excellent from my side ) and in the ending captain Marvel, Bruce banner was there which was ver very much surprising.",5
100459,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings introduced another amazing hero. A villain with a beautifully done backstory, a majestic new world we’re discovering as well. The emotion and acting again was great, Simu Liu will be amazing for years to come. Humor wasn’t too heavy and landed well, few new characters we’ve seen before making appearances. The fighting was some of the best we’ve seen since Winter Soldier, that matrix and Ip Man type fight scenes were epic from start to finish.",5
100460,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Absolutely breathtaking!!! Did I expect for it to be good ? Yes of course, it’s a marvel franchise film! But this exceeded my expectations by far!! Mind blowing visuals and beautiful story line. And the martial arts scenes and stunt work.. wow, was unreal!!!  Deep impactful story with other MCU films “tie-ins” and still had humorous (laugh-out-loud) undertones. It was sooo good !! And most importantly the AAPI WAS REPRESENTED IN AN MCU FILM !!! Love that it had almost a complete Asian cast!! Just an amazing film. A Must see!!!",5
100461,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This was definitely one of the best MCU origin stories. I'd put it in the top five MCU origin stories. Marvel did a good combining the different styles of martial arts in this movie. Shang-Chi incorporated the traditional ""Crouching Tiger H.D., Grandmaster, Hero"" style with the more modern crazy ""Jackie Chan"" style. I personally have a sweet spot in my heart for Asian Martial Arts movies, and this left me satisfied. And we can't forget about the AWESOME DBZ reference in which I almost died in my seat. The soundtrack was good, I definitely played the theme song on the way home.",4
100462,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"4 1/2 out of 5, really great overall, the fight choreography was seriously well thought out and done. The story while being a bit formulaic in some areas is much better than most MCU films. The cast all did well especially Tony Leung. This really feels like a throwback to old Kung Fu adventure films but given the big budget Marvel treatment made by people who truly understand the source material and a director who was clearly passionate about the project as well as it’s lead.",4
100463,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Very fun to watch, the initial action is outstanding, Tony Leung plays Wenwu marvellously, as he manages to encompass the threat and intimidating undertone of Wenwu, whilst simultaneously showcasing his catharsis and vulnerabilities. Additionally, the blend of English and 普通话 makes the movie even more enjoyable to watch as it allows the audience to truly resonate with some of the cultural ideas presented in the movie. Although the third act action is enjoyable, Marvel does its classic 'third act CGI fight' which deviates a little too strongly from the fighting style the movie has presented. The movie also occasionally places humour where it doesn't belong in the third act which undercuts the emotional significance of certain moments in the movie. Overall, an excellent movie and a great way to pass some time, 3.8/5",4
100464,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"MCU movie extended to an Asian supreme country, by saving the world from another perspective of view ot dimension . Perfectly illustrates the family bond  ,Chinese folk tales and emotional feelings or depth ( which is not strong in American culture ). The cinematography ( visualisation) is of higher level , giving a perfect Asian cultural rich feel . Overal , the movie feels like a journey through an unknown rollercoaster . Perfect to watch with family and kids ( they will love it ) .",4
100465,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"It was something new for me. The movie feels a little different than any Marvel film I have encountered. A lot of new materials were covered, from Martial arts to visually expansive scenery of a Chinese village, but many times I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with a lot that has been going on within the screen. With all the action, origin story, new scenery, there’s just a lot to unpack in a 2hr 17mins runtime. While I could say that the film has many things to offer, visually and story wise (which is great), it never soars. When every act seems elevated, nothing appears to be special. The film could use a little more dynamics / rest in between the big scenes. Admittedly, the film is a solid adventure but it needs a little sprinkle of magic given its leanings toward fantasy elements.",4
100466,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This wasn't the best of all the Marvel Movies for my husband and I, but this had a lot of action. And I can reconfirm that dragons are real. And Awkwafina has made her full transition from comedienne to serious actress. Wow! And I gotta find out if she does her own stunts! I didn't really buy a ""love relationship"" between Awkwafina's character, Katy, and Simu Liu's character, Shaun. I felt more of a ""best friend"" vibe and not a ""romantic"" vibe. It was good to see characters from the Marvel universe show up like Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong, as they reminded most audience members that ""yeah, Marvel universe here, hello!"" The story starts off fun and funny, but then it gets serious with Shaun's dad and his background and then his mom and how she dies. Revenge is a moving force within the Marvel universe and so much so here. The martial arts moves in this movie look like a dance to me. So much of a slow moving dance, and then a fast-moving dance. And if the other partner skips a step, he or she is knocked out. It will be interesting to see how Shaun moves into the Marvel universe and where the universe is now and if he will help any of the heroes that we already know. It's a good movie, just not the best of the bunch.",4
100467,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Shang Chi And The Legend of Ten Rings is one of the better parts of MCU, As mentioned in the film's title, the movie is based on Ten Rings mention in The First Iron Man film, The Ten Rings society is a different MCU culture like Wakanda, Asgard and The Russians Red Room. Actor Simu Liu is new to MCU and he will soon join his speed to famous in a comic book role which is for first time in a live action film, Talking about the movie, the movie is enjoyable,  can be enjoyed most in English, the film has long battles but it will touch your want of action, There are great actors in film, good direction, a cool background music, and for it's MCU connection, it has a mid credit scene and a sequel preparation from the post credit scene,  You can see some remarkable comic beings I'm film, Ben Kingsley, Tim Roth, Benedict Wong and two more actors connect it back to McU, the events of this film is might be filmed near Proffesoer Jill's snap just before the showdown .I will give this film 7 rating out of 10.It might releases late on Disney + but now if can, Try to enjoy it in theatres .",4
100468,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"While the trailer of this movie sucked honestly for me, the movie suprisingly turned out to be pretty entertaining. Shaun aka Shang-chi has run away from his past for too long. The ten rings have caught up with him. From searching for his sister to meeting his father to heading off to a mystical village to fighting dragons, this movie has some really good effects coming my way. Though the story wasn't too great at all, the action sequences and VFX effects made up for the lack of a good story. ",4
100469,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"In the first act of the film, I was amazed by Simu Liu's ability to seamlessly move from valet driver to kung fu king. When you throw in great performances from Akwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and Ben Kingsley in addition to an all-time villain MCU performance by Tony Leung, what could possibly go wrong? CGI... a little too much unneeded CGI in the dramatic world-building battle scene. However, it does not take away from the great stuff put on screen. Worth every penny!",4
100470,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This movie is definitely one of marvel's best films! It has stunning visuals, intense plots that keep you at the edge of your seat and a couple of jokes that leave you laughing. What I love the most is the fact that Wenwu is not your typical villain. He has a history and it is up to the audience to decide if he truly is a villain, or not.Overall,  this movie has left me wanting for more! ",4
100471,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography. Visual effects combined with the martial arts looks very pleasing and well executed. Another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures seems enthralling. But what the movie has in abundance brought through  visual richness lacks a strong storyline for an orgin story. Am not sure if comic fans have read shang chi comics (i havent) but the movie definitely didnt do justice for the character unlike other marvel movies that beautifully set the characters along first 4 phases. I was eager to see this new addition in the franchise and came out feeling mixed about the movie. There are lot of worthwhile action packed sequences along with the usual marvel lighthearted humor. A one time worthwhile watch for ant marvel fan or for that matter super hero fanatics. 1ould rtebthis one closer to Thor dark world,3
100472,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,A solid movie that opens up with great action scenes and character development that feels different than anything we have seen so far in the mcu. The movie does drag a bit in the middle and although the best friend was very funny it just felt like some of her one liners could have been removed as well as this one character whose only purpose was to guide our hero to his final destination. I could hardly make out what he was saying but other people laughed at him during the movie so while I didn’t enjoy him others might. It also felt like the movie should of ended with him defeating his father and the scenes after with the two dragons Fighting it out felt excessive and Unnecessary. It also felt like the relationship with the dad and sister weren’t as fleshed out as they could be. The result being a movie that was both to long and made me feel like I wanted more at the same time. Overall I prefer to give ratings of 1-10 because it’s more accurate and I give the movie a 7. Much better then black widow but still lacking in certain areas.,3
100473,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Idk man. I just feel like the arrangement of events made the story a bit dull. Great casting, great classic Chinese movie, awesome cutthroat choreography and Chinese score music. I just suppose I'm a little more wanting then following the entire movie as the rings being both an unknown origin, unknown source of power, and unknown or unexplained way of using them. The rings were just that. Rings. And the mystery of them is never really discussed until the end credits. I suppose it is supposed to be just that; a legend. Unknown, mysterious, and unexplained. Can definitely tell that this film was a hitters bunt into a much larger game that Marvel is playing. The rings and Shang Chi is the first real installment to a future avengers film. As for the plot itself? Pretty standard. Idk what to say I really don't. I liked it. First film since antman and wasp or far from home where I wasn't jumping in my seat afterwards hyped and I just went meh. Again. Not due to the film itself. Just the arrangement of events given and the end credits being the only thing that answered any of the lingering questions I had throughout the film. One spoiler I'll give away is if you think taskmaster was done dirty wait til you see deathdealer. Dude is in and out before you know it. Great film, great casting, awesome graphics, picture perfect Chinese film, not sacrificing mandarin dialogue for the sake of American audiences. Just wish the clips of him as a kid were a bit more revealing before the train sequence. Just kind of got thrown into everything. Suppose they have to with the climate of the MCU. I trust it will be a film giving a very stable foundation for the next 15 years of MCU so taking that into account, it's awesome.",3
100474,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Prior to watching this movie, I had expected it to fall along the lines of black panther, a film where the main character is NOT your generic male Caucasian superhero. However, that is not all this movie is made out to be. While black panther takes place in the fictional country of Wakanda, Shang Chi actually has some basis on Chinese mythology and would be difficult to understand from the perspective of someone who has had little to no experience with Chinese culture. This movie was definitely one of the darker MCU films and feels similar in tone to the Dark Knight trilogy. The villain wasn't some 1 dimensional villain who just wanted to hurt others for the sake of it but felt like a mix between a conqueror like Thanos while also having a noble goal like Kingpin from Spiderman into the spider verse. That said, I felt his redemption arc was too rushed and too short. Overall not as great of a film as as black panther but still decent. I would rate it 7/10",3
100475,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Eh. The entire plot was super predictable, and it was definitely aimed at a younger audience. Most of the jokes weren't funny, and Shang-Chi's friend was just there for comic relief. THAT'S IT. She was completely useless except for the moment she turned into Legolas and got insanely good at the bow and arrow with 4 minutes of practice. Also, I didn't think I would see anyone riding a dragon in a Marvel movie. It was soooo out of place. This movie actually reminded me of Raya and the Last Dragon. Shang-Chi should have been the live-action Mulan we were all waiting for, not a Marvel movie. However, the CGI was good, as always, and the fight scenes were well choreographed. It also had some end-credit scenes that are important to the future of MCU's phase 4, so definitely worth watching. Black Widow was a much better movie overall, although that wasn't a perfect film either. Shang-Chi got 3/5 stars in my opinion, don't trust Rotten Tomatoes.",3
100476,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The movie started out good with the early fighting sequences standing out. I think casting was great and character development moves at a decent pace during the first half of the movie. However, the story moves quite slowly and it loses its momentum in the second half. The fantastic elements that begin to pop up feel a bit in your face and get more attention that they deserve. The final arc was kind of underwhelming and anticlimactic both in its action and in wrapping up the story. The excessive nods to Chinese culture elements become unnecessarily stereotypical and the final battle feels more like a mashup of “Mulan” and “How to train your dragon” than a MCU movie. In the end, the characters are salvageable, even though at times it felt as if the story was more about Tony Leung’s character than Shang-Chi himself, I just hope Marvel finds a better way to incorporate him and its lore into the MCU where it doesn’t feel forced, like they did with Captain Marvel.",3
100477,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I have been reading comic books for almost 40 years and have really enjoyed the MCU versions of these fantastic stories and characters and their heroic messages and lessons. The last two marvel movies however, black widow and Shang Chi, have felt surprisingly lackluster and mediocre. Shang  Chi for example, the titular character, did not have much personality and did not go through any heroic transformation story arc, and the entire movie was just basically a martial art movie like movies already being produced in China and japan. I realize that Shang Chi does not have super powers in the comic book and that the MCU spin on the Mandarin has given him these magic rings as a superpower of sorts, but the story was just not compelling. And the people in the magic village had all these natural magic abilities, but they didn't use them to repel the villains when they showed up nor the evil spirit creatures when they got loose. It's just did not really make sense. The movie felt thrown together really fast and there was just no heart in it at all.",3
100478,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The start was intreeging but the middle was terrible. I hated the character of Trevor he was cringy but in the first iron man he was funny, but in this movie he was pathetic just like the man or women who wrote this absolutely atrocious script but I will give it to you the fight senses we’re some of the best I’ve ever seen in the MCU and the CGI was amazing well done to the animators of this movie but for the rest of the crew I think I have said enough for you. The acting was decent to so congrats to the cast. So overall this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen, up there with Godzilla vs Kong in my respect full opinion",3
100479,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Not bad, but I felt like it was missing something. I think it could use a little less climactic monster fighting and more character moments, especially between the father and his two kids. The sister was just kind of there for most of the scenes and felt a bit wasted. I think this one could use a little more soul and little less action. That’s what makes Marvel great, the characters and the story, not the special effects and grandiose action sequences. Again, not bad, but  I’d skip it if you’re looking for a good stand alone movie. It really only worked for me because of the tie-ins with the MCU as a whole and the potential future stories.",3
100480,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Kung Fu Hustle is a better Kung Fu Comedy. Shang-chi is just a knock off copy. Tony Leung is the real deal, however while his performance in this movie is solid, it is not ground breaking. This is because the story does not give him much material to work with. The first half of  the movie is watchable if you don’t mind exposition after expositions. The final CG battle is sad to watch. Simply put boring. Overall thIs movie is watchable. I went to watch the movie to support the theater and to shake the COVID blues. I suspect many other viewers are watching this movie for the same reason. If you have other fun things to do, do them first and wait for online release.",3
100481,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Disappointing, needless to say. There is a lot of potential in this film that hasn't been properly developed into a beautiful flower. It tries so hard to be something that it's not and it honestly brings the whole movie down. The plot is messy, the actors are known to be brilliant but somehow could not perform, the soundtrack is can, the character developments are weak, the chemistry is even more rubbish. I'll say this however, the cinematography and Tony Leung are amazing. Overall review; tries so hard, rubbish, good for passing the time only.",2
100482,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The actors were phenomenal all did a great job playing their role, however what hold this movie back was the story direction. Like the story changed multiple times during the movie and i got really bored. I also liked how they cut the movie at the Good part hinting at a part 2 which will definitely be better. Overall good actors horrible story direction 2/5
",2
100483,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Not sure why so much hype. Watched and my feeling was ""meh.."". Just becasue disney have money they can take any risk now. The story is written from ATLA (Zuko Alone and his ark and Aang's airbending), Snakeeye. This another overrated movie after GOTG Vol2, Captain Marvel and Dc's Suicide Squad. Bunch of meaningless cameos and the comedy girl who thinks she is funny. Visuals are good in standard, somewhat ok BGM. Totally meaningless screenplay. Wait for it to be available for free on TV or Disney+.",2
100484,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Can someone  please  tell how could Disney/Marvel get the Mandarin  wrong TWICE????!!! Disney/Marvel seem to only be capable  of doing one type of villain from Thanos to Killmonger to Ultran to love sick Mandarin. Don't get me wrong the only character  that I care about was the Mandarin  but that not how the  Mandarin  should  be. Enough  with all this villain  that clearly  just need to go to a bunch of therapy, Enough  for the love of God Enough  with all these emo villain  that needs hug and a shoulder  to lean on. Can you please give me villain that come close to what the comic  books has given us. This  was a waste of time for anyone that was hoping  for a better Mandarin  then the joke we got in Iron Man 3. Trevor  needs to go away and stay gone. Hard pass",2
100485,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Movie was mid not gonna lie. Awkwafina ruins every scene she's in, she was a forced comedic relief. She was thrown into this world the Shang-Chi lived in and somehow survived. She was a burden on Shang-Chi and his mission, all she did was slow down the plot with cringe jokes. But worst of all they tried their absolute best to make her a hero in the end. We had no character developement with her but all of a sudden she is the second coming of Hawkeye and delivers a fatal blow to ""save the day."" All in all this movie was better than Captain Marvel, but if I have to see Awkwafina in another Marvel film I think I'll lose it.",2
100486,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Visually beautiful, but the huge amount of plot holes and lazy writing was too much. The reintroduction of Trevor was just a waste of film and the break out from dads dungeon was reminiscent of the horrific writing you would find in Disney's variations of Star Wars. Shang Chi side kick Katy of course learned to master the bow and arrow in less than a hour and saved the day. Predictable and Pathetic. The last act was a sloppy mess of confusion with soul sucking whatever's and a big dragon.  Unfortunately this film was too formulated even for me.",2
100487,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,One of the worst marvel movies. The bad guy had the best story and the most character development while all the good guys were sort of just there getting powers and not experiencing any consequences or development. It gets really predictable to where I could literally guess the exact ending by the middle of the movie and it was really weird seeing akwafina in the mcu. Could have been a great film but a lot of story choices really ruined it for me. It would also be nice to get a Asian based movie without something to do with summoning a dragon for no reason.,2
100488,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,They finally learned and didnt get woke with this film. Action and visuals were amazing. acting was great but the plot was so bad. Plot holes everywhere that were never explained or explained to the degree of a child understanding it. The actors were great but there lines and plots were twisted and boring. I was so excited to see this and then I actually watched it.,2
100489,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Almost fell asleep in this one. I would say one of the worst marvel movies yet. Poor story, no real attachment to any of the characters. Me and the wife went on date night and it felt like a terrible use of my time. I went in with no expectations hadn’t even seen the trailer, but still nothing was surprising. It really felt like it should have been on Disney plus.",2
100490,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This was unfortunately a pretty uninspired, boring and a needlessly long movie that is abusing the flasback system and is almost entirely made of exposition.Once someone interesting shows up the focus is changed back to the main characters making you wonder why they would tease us with a interesting persona and then never show them again , the comedy was pretty bad to be honest and it should have focused more on the comic relief than at the characters trying to make jokes. The only positive thing that I can tell about this movie that the small amount of fights were pretty great and badass , especially the bus scene.Music is forgetful and the acting was awkward and not that fine.",2
100491,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This movie was terrible. There was no reason for Shang chi to hate his father so much. His father loved their mother and loved the kids. He trained the son to avenge his mother, even though he was more than capable of doing it himself. Shang chi was an ungrateful little turd. And the last boss battle came out of know where. A good villain is what makes a good movie, there was no good villain in this movie. The last dragon creature did not add any value to the movie except for being a spectacle.",1
100492,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"shang chi is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever had the opportunity to lay my eyes on. wow. i’m disgusted. truthfully, i didn’t even finish the movie - i left after i had my waffle fries. regardless, an awful movie. was watching the film as my other buddies were laughing at the most mainstream jokes and they were actually completely entertained by the movie. quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen as well. what a weird taste of movies my friend arin has, wow, still in disbelief.",1
100493,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"One of the worst ones yet, still better than black panther and Thor dark world.  You don’t care about the characters. The story is pretty boring. Action good. Same stuff as crouching tiger nothing special. The ten rings are nothing special. Ben Kingsley is the best set as a tie in to to universe. Pretty weak tie in though",1
100494,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The bad guy - dragon demon - seemed kind of boring to me. I was hoping for something more relevant to the MCU as a whole. All other characters were solid. But also, I HATED that they turned the 10 rings into basically mini Thor hammers - the 10 unique abilities they had in the comics were much more interesting to me.",1
100495,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This was not good. The friend character Katy is both bland and annoying. She serves no functional purpose. The main character is bland and is the driving force of this movie for approximately 0% of it. The attempts at comedy fell very flat 9 times out of ten. I can't remember the last time I wanted to walk out of a theater, but geez did I ever.Marvel has lost its magic.",1
100496,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Movie is ok...but Katy's acting is irritating, there are much better asian actors out there. She tries to be funny but isn't.

100497,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,Movie is draggy and lack of captivating moments. Plot is much predictable.  Feels like awkwafina is added in for comical purpose as the plot alone is too boring. But I am impressed with Tony Leung’s acting.,1
100498,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Contrived, several good moments though generally counts on Marvels name carrying it through. Very predictable. One minute you think it’s ok, then kinda good. Then back to terrible. Just lots of money thrown at it basically.",1
100499,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Worst acting ever! The comedy was forced. The 2 main characters did not even have good chemistry like your Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, MIB, Thor and Valkyrie, etc. The story development was too coincidental. Although it had good fighting scenes a lot of the movie felt cringe.",1
100500,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Had a lot of hopes for this movie. But ended up very disappointed. The story was poor. Did not have a good rising action. The worst part of the entire movie was the supporting cast and comic relief. The side kick, Awkwafina, was note funny and mostly a very disturbing person in this role.",1
100501,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,It was pretty entertaining...sure there are some long dialogs but without them many viewers would've been even more confused than what they already are...probably the same whom gave this movie pretty bad reviews calling it boring woth not enough fight scenes and calling it the worst of the franchise 🙄😏 we enjoyed it and even watched it twice to see all the easter eggs and get the whole story that I might have missed while getting my cup of coffee or a new bag of popcorn..I was glad to see Neo and Trinity all grown up and how their stories evolved since we saw them last.,5
100502,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I rated this film 10/10 because I don’t care other people’s bad reviews cause this matrix movie is fantastic! Neo is my favourite character because he’s the one! He has strong 💪🏻  power and I loved it 😍 Dear Bad reviews people, trust me this film is amazing! If you’re typing bad reviews. Then don’t watch the New Matrix.
",5
100503,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The movie was outstanding! The reviews are saturated with people who believe the movie was making a political statement when in fact, it just addresses societies superficial norms and shatters that way of thinking. Again, the movie is great! Go see it! 💯🙏🏾",5
100504,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I was unsure but very hopeful of this movie. I was a huge fan of the other Matrix movies. I was pleasantly surprised by this one! I found myself sucked right back in cheering for Neo and Trinity as before! I for one really hope that they continue to make more of these!!!,5
100505,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I was a bit worried that after my nostalgia had pasted, that the actual return to the Matrix would be a letdown. But I am so glad to report that I had nothing to be worried about. The action was unreal, the script was okay BUT the story, the reason for the return or resurrection was so clever that any failings of the movie (it wasn't perfect) can be happily looked over and I HOPE that there will be a Matrix V! GO TRINITY!",5
100506,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I didn't know the matrix could get anymore meta, but it did. If you are heading into the cinema and you are ready to put ur thinking hat on, you gonna have a hard time. It not just a Sci-fi/Action movie, its romance, philiosophical and  thought provoking. Amazing work of art.",5
100507,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,This movie was the best! It gave me 20 years of wanting answers solved due to Neo and Trinitys death I would like to come into contact with the director ASAP to personally congratulate her and tell her how it was a ,5
100508,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Love it or hate it, it’s THE MATRIX! Just REMEMBER that. Just enjoyed and lived the moments. Maybe people that were born after the first part of the movie, can’t exactly relate. But recommend them to go back and watch from the first part to get to follow the storyline. Overall, 10/10 for me. This movie is a great foundation for the next part, MATRIX 5! :D",5
100509,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Best commentary on forced movie squeals I've watched. The Wachowski's call out their studio hard core and spend the first quarter of the movie telling the audience that ""The Matrix was done, we didn't want to do this, they forced us, so just have fun with it."" And it was honestly very fun.",5
100510,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"A pure nostalgia trip for those like myself who remember seeing the first film in theaters back in 1999.  Will require a second viewing.  One critic described it as a ""meta headache"".  I'm inclined to agree.  But it did keep me interested and thrilled to the end.",5
100511,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"My word of advice - don't listen to anyone who'll curse and scold this new Matrix part. Resurrection is a huge and triumphant improvement over last 2 weaker sequels, and this new one delivers both great fun as well as excellent action-packed sci-fi thriller. With all the impressive CGI and excellent casting, perfect pacing, huge irony, absolutely tasteful elements of modern coffee / hipster culture, all together Matrix brings us a superb fourth part that both entertains and makes you ponder a lot. All the puzzle pieces are in perfect places here - tempo, visuals, sound, stunts, great jokes at the expense of Keanu and Carrie Ann. Reeves are Moss are impeccable here, as well Neil Patrick Harris who is excellent as The Analyst. The younger cast is a warm welcome, too, as they deliver their parts with gusto and fervor. What also adds a certain flavor to the part is a gorgeous mix of older scenes and new reality. New Agent Smith is a dear darling, especially with his sarcastic remarks and excellent humor at his own expense. I will not disclose the necessary plot details but wanna say, this film is a real must-see, due to its smart plot and endearing mixture of old and new, with all these 20 years at our belt, it is so touching and moving to see our old heroes being brisk and energetic again, strong and superb, smart and sincere.",4
100512,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Resurrections is a great pop corn movie.it’s certainly the weirdest mainstream action film I’ve seen since The Last Action Hero. It does everything I that I wanted a soft reboot/sequel to do and very little that I didn’t. The first third of the movie is extremely meta, so much so that some folks might be put off by how heavy handed this can get. I personally loved its unabashed sledgehammering home of its self-awareness. The fight sequences were as heartstoppingly balletic as they’ve ever been, the dialogue, went from being sparkling and witty to dispassionate exposition dumps, which is fine and best of all Seeing Neo and Trinity on the big screen again. ",4
100513,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"People just love to be entertained, I can't emphasize this enough. We have been accustomed to a kind of pattern in every medium that upon consuming we start to automatically like without questions asked. It can't be helped but who do we blame for that? Ourselves as audience/consumers or the corporate machines? It's an endless cycle without a point of origin. Everything runs on an algorithm now. Nothing is original anymore if you think about it. If you understand it then you will probably have a great time with The Matrix Resurrections. ""Welcome to the real world.""",4
100514,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I loved it particularly because of its high concepts and self-conscious delivery. It's the most Meta movie I've ever seen. It does a decent job for a movie with 2 hours and 30 minutes of runtime, the actions sequences are good but nothing new that you've not seen in the last 20 years of Hollywood filmmaking. Now many of you may wonder 'The Matrix' movies are supposed to have high-octane action shots followed by cerebral plots, and I get it. It's just that it felt like it was intentionally pushed to being secondary but not without reason. It becomes pretty clear the film wants to convey a solid message (not often found in movies) that is extremely relevant today. So if you're here for the crack, bang, and boom, sorry to say it might disappoint you.",4
100515,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The movie may feel slow and self-absorbed (with the trilogy) to some of you but the story behind it is extraordinary, it keeps on adding more layers to the Matrix lore, not to mention (again) Lana has really found an interesting way to present it. Now coming to the actors, Keanu and Carrie bring forth magnetic chemistry that's convincing enough to move you. The Matrix and Neo & Trinity are inseparable.",4
100516,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,So this movie was good don’t get me wrong it had plenty of action and a good storyline but I just found it abit confusing to be honest I mean it kept jumping from 1 reality to another and that just confused me but I do have to say I have not watched the other 3 Matrix Movies so maybe if I watched them I would of understood this movie a lot better. But anyway I still throughly enjoyed this movie because come on you have the amazing Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss and also the amazingly sexy Priyanka Chopra Jonas so what’s not to like with a amazing cast like that.,4
100517,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,So I understood that the Matrix was basically this kind of virtual video game and their were these bad guys trying to control it or something and yeah it’s quite confusing but I got the basic idea of the movie I just wish they could of explained it better. But anyway their were amazing and beautifully stunning locations in this movie one of the main ones where the movie is mainly shot is the Beautiful city of San-Francisco I mean come on that’s a beautiful city wouldn’t you agree.,4
100518,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,So yeah overall this movie is still definitely worth a watch but I recommend paying attention to this movie so you can understand what’s happening because this is that type of movie were you have to pay attention to understand what’s happening in the movie and maybe watch the other 3 Matrix Movies before this one so you know who everyone is and what it is all about but yeah you don’t have to but I think it would give you a better grasp of what the movie is about.,4
100519,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"It was interesting, to say in the least. Knowing what Lana Wachowski was trying to capture with this movie - a love story that shows repeating cycles of history never go the way they did before - really helped with my potential disappointment with this movie. ",4
100520,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The downfalls are sadly just as glaring for me. I wish the new Morpheus had had his own name - he was so cool and so drastically different, that he deserved the respect of his own character. I was not a fan of how ""meta"" the movie was, and wish the story could have separated away from the trilogy, continuing on as a sequel but without the whole ""the matrix is a game, here are dozens of clips from the original movies randomly disbursed throughout, and people fanboy over this 'game' and explain what it meant!"". Also is that really Neo, or just depressed John Wick? Speaking of.depressed - it reawoke my existential crisis about the matrix (social expectations) we currently live in, and has kept me up all night tossing and turning, questioning what really matters in life and how to break free of what doesn't. I still don't have an answer, only anxiety. (Lana if you ever read this review, please finish freeing my mind. I'm currently stuck in the Mobil station.)",4
100521,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Could of been better in my opinion. Kinda dumb that the plot went from saving Neo to saving his girlfriend. They had so much freedom with the plot after the third film, but they went for a more of a love story rather then the usual plot. Like saving the human race from technology.",3
100522,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"As an original fan of the trilogy I must say I’m a little disappointed in this plot narrative.  Overall the movie had its moments but it didn’t have a clear motive going forward and of course in todays society and all of our current issues, the writers had to make this movie political which is unacceptable.  We go to the movies to escape reality NOT be reminded constantly of how our world leaders are ignorant and constantly fighting with each other.",3
100523,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Bit of a let down, I'm writing this review about 20 minutes in, the woman they used as the new main character is pc wokeness gone mad, I will not be surprised if its revealed she's as a transgender non binary vegan, they should have given her normal hair and normal lines, she performes so many lines with this fake tough tone and expression, it's a shame because I know that she is a good actor, not good enough for me to know her name but she was iron firsts sidekick in the marvel TV series she was good in that, but this just pure cringing.",3

100525,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Well the movie was not what I expected.  To be such a fan to see them both together again,  trinity and neo was great,  plus have powers too, ok... Good job to pysch counselor,  he did enough,  Mr. Smith? Nope. Was not worth the script.  Glad I didn't watch in theater.",3
100526,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The best part of the movie was Carrie and Keanu. The acting was great, the dialogue and storyline were abysmally terrible. It was moderately entertaining, but a total cringeworthy mess of writing. I can honestly say they did this one dirty just like the new star wars movies. Hard pass on any future movies.",3
100527,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Something about it seems lacking. It does not have that ""Matrix"" vibe. Maybe it is the change of some important characters (including Agent Smith) or the plot but something is just lacking. However, I love how they added clips from the original trilogy and the graphics. So I give it 3 stars",3
100528,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I set the bar super low and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't fall asleep or was off put by it being too long or dramatic. Neil Patrick Harris's performance was entertaining and Keanue looked almost convincing for a change, but I think it was because he didn't know he was being filmed.",3

100530,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Compare to previous, no bueno. Fake Morpheus. Too many new characters. I prefer the originals. Any attempt to hand off the torch and keep this going, will fail. Only 1 Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity. The story line was not as good in my opinion either. Finally, I would rather see some Kung Fu and gun fights, then simply throwing out hands like some D&D Cleric.",3
100531,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"First of all, that wasn't Mr. Smith. He kept calling Neo Tom (he typically says MR Anderson) so it never felt like smith. Neither did Morpheus, the fact that Morpheus somehow is a Sentient and Niobi is still alive just takes away from all the prior movies. It just didn't feel like the matrix. Also I think its something with the whole Wachowski turning into a female that plays some part in giving Trinity powers from ""THE ONE"". Feels like she tried to add more female roles even ending with Rage Against The Machine Wake Up Cover by a female. As well as trying to connect as many pieces to the first movie really seemed like they tried to hard to achieve what the first movie did. I cant say I liked it. The ending also doesn't really show that they probably started the war against The machines again but I guess trinity being ""THE ONE"" as well is more important.",2
100532,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Huge matrix fan... I can't get passed the fact there's no real reason for this movie to be made, the plot, there is no plot really... The story ended in 3, also can't get passed the replacement of a few characters, not the fact that they replaced them, i understand what they were going for, just, didn't feel like those characters tho, how easy is it to nail Mr. Smith? Come on.. weak, very not-matrix action scenes, remember when an agent put anxiety into you? What is the goal here? I hate when they ruin the nostalgia of great stories by watering them down with quantity to make a quick buck, thought matrix was better than this",2
100533,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I struggled to give this movie two stars and am glad I didn't go pay to see it.. it truly felt like the game of thrones fanale. The directors were trying to do too much in one film. The fight scenes(which were numerous) were rather bland compared to the original trilogy. I was excited to see the matrix get a breath of life again but this movie seemed stale and totally reliant on nostalgia... They brought back characters but either didn't spend any time on them or they replaced actors like Morpheus.,2
100534,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I can't believe I'm giving this movie 2 stars, I absolutely love the matrix and the sequels, plus the animatrix. This movie is not even an echo of them.. It feels lower budget than the original, the only thing I can conclude is that when the wachowskis were a team both input and visual styles combined to make great movies, under just Lana's direction it's meh.also maybe covid, lockdowns, made the movie harder to create. The colors are off in the shooting style, (green filters while in the matrix) is way different.The characters seem worn.. The Smith actor calls neo ""Tom"" not ""Mr Anderson"" and his acting style is way way off. The cinematography that made the orginal amazing is absent.",2
100535,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I loved the trilogy, but this movie was a mess. You can tell they really wanted to somehow recapture that special something of the first movie, but it came across... flat. The first movie had spectacle, new or improved ideas (bullet time), a decent story, and cool questions and deep thoughts to apply to simple things like... what is real? This movie seemed to favor prior film allusions or cuts (especially in the slooooow first half) over spectacle, nothing wowed me like bullet time did (in fact, a few times I thought the cgi was cringy or filled with shortcuts, sometimes with poor quality, and sometimes with replicated animations especially in faster sequences where most probably wont take notice on first viewing) the story seemed ... a very belabored stretch, and frankly this batch of deep questions posed seemed to silly to bother pondering given how little I ended up enjoying the movie.",2
100536,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I wasn’t really sure what was going on in this movie..  I thought neo was spose to be like a hero ..but like he doesn’t travel around in time with his friend and get famous people from history for any book reports. And there was no Wookiee. I waited for that space gorilla but he never showed up. Disappointing. And then there was the confusing sub plot about Bitcoin. I mean why did neo keep hinting to Morpheus to buy Bitcoin? ‘Buy some Bitcoin Morpheus , buy some Bitcoin’ . guess that’s how he can afford all those rad clothes and stuff. I don’t know how or what happened but after the film ended I couldn’t find my car in the car park and I think I saw someone from the matrix following me. Yes, an agent . I had to hide in the fire escape for a few hours and then I found my car and then I drove home . Something isn’t right at home now and I wonder if that space gorilla is spying on me, quietly living in my roof watching me and coming down when I’m not home and eating the butter.",2
100537,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I've been watching the matrix movies since launch and in all honest opinion, this movie was a mess. It had some good moments but the story did not hit home like the others did. The new characters honestly are easily forgettable, Jada Pinket was pretty much pointless, and most of the acting was like its time for basic acting lessons again. I am not a writer of any kind, but I can grab my laptop and start typing away ideas that I already have and make a better matrix 4 movie in 2 days. Oh and the comedy was pointless, none of that hit home. If they do another matrix movie it needs to be much better. Now I just hope that John Wick 4 doesn't suck but we shall see.",2
100538,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I’m a huge fan of the matrix saw all three films I love the first 2 films unapologetically and the 3rd I used to hate alot but I recently rewatched it and it’s okay I guess idk it’s a mixed bag for me but! This movie was the worst of the franchise.. the only scenes I cared about were the scenes with neo and trinity but there wasn’t enough of that.. this movie was just all over the place very hard to follow I didn’t know what the hell was going on from beginning to end.. but I will say that I was satisfied with the ending for neo and trinity.. but everything else I could care less about how could Lana W. Do this to this beloved franchise and these new characters I could care less about!!! And I hated!!!! The new Morpheus the way they treated his character was so disrespectful it’s a shame that this movie turned out like this.. it was hot garbage and a complete mixed mess..!!! And I found out that Lawrence fishburne wanted to come back as Morpheus.. but thank God!! He didn’t because this movie was a disaster!!! But like I said before I liked the ending for Neo and trinity!! Now WB probably killed this franchise so let this be the end of the hero’s journey.. overall I give it 2 stars because all I like in this movie was the neo and trinity scenes and it wasn’t even much of that smh .. very disappointed!!,2
100539,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"It was ok. If you want to kill 2 1/2 hours and slip back into the matrix world than this movie will fill that need.If your hoping to see any new ideas coming from this movie then you will be disappointed. It’s just the same rehash of things that had happened in the original trilogy except updated for our times now. Plus It’s an even more of a love story now. But it was worth it to watch once, I won’t rewatch over and over like I did with the first 3. On a side note now that I think about it? There really wasn’t a real reason for them to bring him out of the matrix? They didn’t need him for anything? They risk their home really for nothing but to bring him back for nothing but to bring him back? Lol! Sorry I’m just ranting now.",2
100540,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,A real steamy stinky one. I loved the trilogy but I found myself cringing while watching this. Starts off pretty interesting tbh but then just takes a nose dive. The plot was basically “How Neo Got His Groove Back.” Two stars because some of the ideas and concepts did land on their mark but most missed it entirely. The dark and weird atmosphere of the trilogy was gone. The action scenes were not what I was expecting compared to the others. Neil Patrick Harris just doesn’t work as the main bad guy. I like him as an actor but he doesn’t fit into this world very well with his bubbly and silly personality. If you like this and are a Matrix fan then good for you. I wanted to like this one and really did try to enjoy it but I couldn’t help but sigh and roll my eyes at most of the scenes.,2
100541,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Honestly, very disappointed with everything about this film, from a complete change in story line coupled with bad acting and long drawn out scenes. It like a TV series with three episodes rolled into one. Basically, they just took snipets of all the previous movies and made a nostalgic remake executed poorly in the hope the audience would be too ignorant to see any form of fresh creativity. Then trying to change the sub plot to indicate that neo had made a game called the matrix to somewhat dumb it down so the masses can comprehend, there's a simple answer to everything, it was just a game. Morphuis's role, personality and his overall part in this film is a mockery! This film is the scary movie of the matrix films. A joke! ",1
100542,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie is incoherent, and doesn’t sufficiently explain how things got to be how they are with regard to the two main characters. It feel like they tried and failed with too many plot holes. The fight scenes are largely a muddled mess. They did great casting Neil Patrick Harris as the Analyst. I enjoyed seeing him in every scene he was in, but the movie as a whole lost its mystique and the narrative relied far too much on the audience having to make sense of what they were seeing. Far from being an experience that one carries away like the first film tended to do, this movie will be forgotten by the audience a few days after seeing it.",1
100543,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"A convoluted plot with no particular aim or points, they did not seek to free people's minds or bodies, breakdown the social constructs or systematic abuses from being in The matrix. Neo's etire aim was self-serving to save his girlfriend and nothing for the people around him. This script was confused and pulled in many different directions yet not actually going anywhere. It was a confused plot not made to rebel against an evil system but to nod to it. It presents itself as trying to be woke but falls asleep on highlighting any real issues. It did not use this time to have you think or question anything really. Its felt like a waste of time and really hurt the franchise in my eyes. I also think that the Morpheus and agent Smith acting were far below the standard of the originals. I think this script is proof that the rumors are true that ",1
100544,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie should have been slotted for 7 PM on the CW after Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When the film wasn't being nostalgic and cheesy, it was promoting transhumanism. The film goes into a new Matrix or reality that promotes the idea that feelings and perception is more real than facts. You know kind of like the new progressive thought process. It's painfully obvious and also the fact that we are all aware the directors had surgery and changed genders makes it even more predictable it's painful. The film also lacks any sort of real character development or cultural similarity to the characters; obviously because they are heavily dependent on sales in China with a plot this thin. It's worth a watch just to see how unoriginal and predictable it is.",1
100545,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I had my doubts about this when i first heard and read that they were doing a 4th Matrix film and i was proven right. It was just very painful to watch and couldn't wait till it finished. Glad i just streamed this instead of wasting my money to see this at the cinema. It was just bloody awful from start to end as it was getting frustrating with the constant jumping back the way with rehashing stuff with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Matrix, the acting was piss poor especially the new Agent Smith guy and Morpheus guy, the story and plot was all over the place and it just lacked a lot of elements. It just felt like a horrible, cheap and nasty remake of the first Matrix film in all honestly as it was just a repeat of the same old stuff all over again but with less action. Even the acting felt forced from all the cast because they just lacked in everything. I like Keanu Reeves but even he couldn't save this monstrosity and abomination of a film. He's a brilliant actor and he's better than this. I don't know why they made this as no one asked for it. They should have just left it after the 3rd one as there was no need for another one after the way the 3rd one ended. It's been 18 years since the last one came out so there's been too long a gap now to make a follow up as it never works out and this just proves it. Just leave the franchise alone ffs. Don't waste your time, money and energy seeing this folks honestly. It's 2 hours and 28 minutes of your life that you'll never get back again. It was that bad, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was better than this and that's saying a lot. It's just another cash cow.",1
100546,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I literally just finished watching The Matrix 4. I don’t honestly know where to start. This movie is embarrassing. Keanu Reeves is by far one of my favorite actors ever. I wish he would have declined to do this movie after reading the screenplay. Either Lana was deliberately trying to create a terrible movie, or clearly the original writer of the Third Eye is the reason for her fabricated success. It seems like the spirit that guided this franchise to stardom completely left the franchise. Every aspect of the plot was pathetic, forced, and down right silly in comparison to how flawlessly epic the original trilogy of The Matrix was. They had no business allowing this 4th movie to happen, & should have left it alone. What I would have enjoyed if they would have dived further into the multiverse of The Matrix assimilation rather assembling a knock off one sided perspective of a metaverse spoof. There needed to be better acting as well. This is a disgrace, & i’m literally going to act like I didn’t just waste 2 1/2 hours of my time. Next time: put more thought into the actual movie then all of your creativity into some promotion trailers.",1
100547,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I was reluctant to watch this knowing about the horrendous character changes and it’s just a thorn I will never be able to get out of my side. Smith and Morpheus are the most Iconic supporting characters of all time in my humble opinion. not having Hugo and Lawrence there just spits in the face of this franchise’s legacy. Not to mention the new supporting characters just didn’t bring “the sauce” like the original movies. The action sequences were lack luster, it also felt like the story line was packing in way to much to be unpacked in one movie. As for the analyst character I feel they could have found a better darker mind twisting character instead of Neil Patrick Harris, nothing against him I just think he seems out of place here.",1
100548,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"This movie was an absolute mess. I wonder what was the original pitch. The plot was terrible. The video game premise and all of that fan service about “what is the Matrix?” Felt like utter fan service and it did nothing to move the plot (whatever it was) in a movie that should have been edited (yet another example of Hollywood folks falling in love with their product). The movie felt like cosplay with a bunch of fans running around creating their version of a Matrix 4. The fight scenes were pretty bad... Don’t get me started with the fight scene with the Merovingians… it was just ridiculous. Impotent Neo (he can’t fly and barely fight) loses his powers while trying to save the damsel in distress, only to find she has bigger balls than him (oh, and she can fly all of a sudden). How is Agent Smith (a program) still alive (wasn’t his code expunged by Neo already?) or at least wasn’t his code purged like The Oracle’s? How are machines living in harmony with humans? I mean, what is their power source? It felt like a made for TV movie, often had the colors and feel of a soap opera… is it the cameras they used? Why did Keanu say yes to this mess?",1
100549,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"You can't spoil anything this bad, but, for the readers' sake, MINOR SPOILERS.  First off, I'm a huge fan of the series, even when it did taper off some with the film preceding this one.  But this....mother of pearls...this....is so bad.  So I think we all went in having a relative expectation of what this movie was likely going to be.  Neo, Trinity, Morpheus reunited in a secretly love-driven, martial arts, world warping-science fiction-reality-bending adventure.  You'd be wrong.  Beyond the initial, and frankly overzealous use of ""inclusion"" characters, this is yet another ""woke"" disaster film.  As expected, the main characters, namely Reaves and Moss,  do their absolute best to be the glue that keeps the whole thing moving.  Mateen (Morpheus) seemed lost, and I'm partial to his acting typically.  Most of the cast struggled with the same problem.  It's as if no auditions were held to see who would best ""fit"" the role of each character.  The core of the movie had hope, but from cheesy agents, lackluster effects, ill-casted characters, and an obnoxiously incoherent storyline, this, sadly to say, is a dumpster fire both in and outside of the Matrix.",1
100550,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I didn’t have a lot of hope with this sequel since the trilogy had a good ending hinting the death of neo. But I could see how the this new plot was somehow poorly fitted into the trilogy. When a movie already has a set standard in how the script is written, costumes, cgi and special effects set it’s hard to see how this new sequel horribly ignored any of the past movies with this new technology and the same budget as past matrix you would think that they would have wanted to perfect what they couldn’t before but watching this it’s lazy done. The new millennial language that got into the script made this movie a joke. Morpheus character was so poorly written making him look like an unbelievable joke of a character who we couldn’t even take serious when in the trilogy the original actor was portrayed as a respectable character who made the whole matrix believable for neo and the audience, on top with the awful performance and costumes. The way this whole movie was written and performed felt like they were try to make it bad I have no words for this this does not need to exist no thank you the matrix trilogy is complete",1
100551,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I don't know why people are hating on this movie ! It's a Great movie, it's fun and it's matrix. It explains a lot, it takes awhile to understand. You have to pay attention and connect the dots! But I loved everything about it ! People just need to open their minds and enjoy the ride. It all connected and can't wait for more",5
100552,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I really enjoyed the movie and the blending together of all the Matrix movies. I absolutely love the new Morpheus actor even though I thought going into movie I wouldn't. Lawrence Fishburn just such great actor but I was blown away with new actor how he captured the same essence of Morpheus character. Great job and great movie.,5
100553,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,Purely enchanting with a broader scope than the previous film in the trilogy. It's breathtaking slick and stylish action is at its peak benchmark level. It will absolutely gather followers in the years to come. A warm-hearted sequel depicting the contemporary issues with singular awesomeness.,5
100554,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Pure nostalgia for Matrix lovers . New storyline with upgrades in technology . On the bullet time part , there could be an improvement in action sequence - maybe like the revolutionary bullet time scene , Lana could have come with something new . Enjoyed it ! Kudos . Looking forward to Matrix 5 , and improved action ! Return of Neo & Trinity ! ",5
100555,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I just finished watching the Matrix Resurrections, and I have to say this brings back all the memories from the first Matrix. I remember getting recommended this movie and started watching it. I then fell into The Matrix franchise, and I have been waiting so long for this movie!! I couldn't believe myself when it came out on the 22nd, because time went by so fast. I remember when I finished The Matrix Revolutions, and tried to search up when the 4th would come out. When I looked at the release date I thought ""man. That's a long time wait."" But I was wrong! I loved this movie and cannot wait for the 5th! I'm rooting for Trinity and Neo!!",5
100556,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Being a big fan of the original trilogy I really enjoyed it.  I felt it was a good place to take the series.  It had pretty much all of the elements of the originals.  It was a bit to wrap your head around (as were the originals) and it would have been cool to see more original cast, but nonetheless I think it was an awesome movie overall.",5
100557,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,Absolutely a great movie. Storyline was insane. A very complex movie for sure. The acting and graphics were riveting. Excellent job with tiring it together and explaining it..  Personslly I thought there was tons of action and even explaining why the relationship was so important. Best matrix by far,5
100558,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I liked everything; the action and the story. I liked how the plot was about resurrecting neo and Trinity. I love their love story. I almost cried when they finally kissed. This love story makes me want to have the same love as them. Everyone played their part beautifully. I would recommend this movie. I would definitely watch this movie again.,5
100559,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I'm a fan of Keanu due to his personality and his life experience. So I am a little bias and this may qualify as a spoiler but he delivers a new outlook on Neo and the next chapter of the Matrix. The movie focuses on the sacrifice made by both Neo and Trinity in the last movie and more sacrafices reuniting them for this chapter. I'm a bit nostalgic so loved it.,5
100560,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"It's a story about Love and Flat Earth, the matrix is the globe earth zombies believe we're magically glued to and IO is 1 and 0 as in binary which is also a metaphor for male and female. True love generated by 2 humans (Male and Female, yin + yan) represent the most powerful force in existence. Strong enough to snatch souls from heaven and bring them to earth.",5
100561,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I debated on giving The Matrix Resurrections a three star review however, after some consideration I deemed it deserving of four stars, at least IMO.  Obviously the first Matrix set the bar high and as any Matrix fan will tell you the sequels, parts II & III wrapped up the original trilogy in so so fashion.  Times have changed and thus has the Matrix and I for one am glad to see it reinvented while still paying tribute to its originals.  I can think of no better kick-butt couple in all of movie history outside of Neo & Trinity except perhaps that of Micky & Mallory from Natural Born Killers.  That being said, do not believe the negative reviews of this film.  It is certainly better than it’s last two films but, per the usual, nothing has topped the original.  On a side note, I thought that I would miss Lawrence Fishbourne as Morpheus however it ended up being Hugo Weaving, as Mr. Smith, that I missed the most.",4
100562,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Every one loved the first film. Resurrections reminds us why. While not the revolution we would have loved, Resurrections does offer us fans that were clamoring for more action after the disasterous duology of Reloaded and Revolutions a second chance. The action is a bit slower but the pacing is really smooth. There's plenty of call backs to the past films and some fun laughs about things people hated in the sequels. Seeing Neo and Trinity back together is fun and exciting. The third act is stellar action. While nothing tops the lobby shootout or anything, there's some fun ""Whoa!"" moments that make you go ""Wow, the Matrix doesn't suck anymore!"" If you got HBO Max and a few hours, you can't go wrong.",4
100563,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"LOVED IT!! Love the idea behind  it!( off course  I wish there  where  more actions scenes) I felt some things where a bit rushed and the story was fast, but I kinda think that's because  of ppls attention  span now😅😅, again  love the movie, the new cast was awesome fit,  love seeing  some of the more veteran  cast as well, it was a solid blend. The potential  for another Matrix  trilogy sequence  I am hopeful  for🤞🏾🤞🏾.Now ima  Rewatch  the other 3 along with the animatrix  with the kid to fill him in on this awesomeness, and then go break out the video game 😁😁✌🏾✌🏾 a great flic to watch
",4
100564,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Okay, so this is an interesting way to end off 2021. First off, I will say The Matrix Resurrections is definitely better than the two weaker sequels. The reason being is because though this served as a sequel, it practically served a double purpose as a reboot just in modern day! Which I thought was pretty nice because 9/10 the original film in the franchise series is always the best, and in this case The Matrix can still be considered at the top. However, this movie felt in a sense that it augmented some certain aspects of the original since it referenced so many factors in it, just with some new characters and an altered plot to try to revive such an old franchise NONE of us saw coming back, especially after so long. Although debatable on whether necessary or not, the story technically was open to continue, so all in all, this movie was not a waste. ",4
100565,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The reactions from both appraisals and critiques are both valid, but for an ultimately good reason. Everyone took something different away from the original movies because they were jam packed to a trilogy. With this in mind, not everyone's love for the film will be solidified with resurrections. The movie doesn't give much food for thought to my disappointment. But i did find my love for the world of the matrix expanded upon. The new agent smith is actually a terrfic direction. Expanding on his growth from program to sentient, whilst still capturing Weavings more identifiable cold attitude. Action was somewhat disappointing due to a lack of longshots from the original. But even with the things i loved gone (philosophy that challenges, intricate system building on the matrix lore), it still gives us our 2 cyberpunk heroes 1 more chance to show the young of today that there was a time we were fearless. And many of us want that back!",4
100566,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Like most things, this will depend on your expectations. If the first Matrix blew your mind and created a life altering experience that you expect to be repeated, save your time and money. That said, I found this to be excellent. I thought they did a fantastic job weaving a story that was primarily about Neo and Trinity into a world that we all are familiar with; that being the Matrix. They managed to preserve a level of self-deprecating humor without making light of the world we were visiting, which is not an easy task. The action, choreography and acting all work here, as is expected. It felt a bit like a closing chapter, and if that turns out to be the case, the close works.",4
100567,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I rewatched the movie and the second time around I liked it better. I think it was an okay reboot. It now allows the matrix world to be explored in what I am assuming will be more movies. There was some confusion the first time around which was cleared on the second watch. Like the role Morpheus plays. I didn't understand the first time around that neo had purposely made a version of him in hopes he would re awaken him. I have changed my rating to a 4. Nothing will ever compare to the first. This is a fact. And that movie can be watched without reloaded and revolutions and still stand alone. But it is nice to see that the future may hold some interesting stories in the matrix universe. Let's just hope and pray it does not become like the fast and furious. Cash grab? Yes. Mostly. But I think many people went in expecting more, as did I, and were let down. Well I can say watching it again opened my eyes to that it's actually not so bad. ",4
100568,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Don't go watch this with expectations of it being like the first three. It would be similar to comparing an X-Men movie to a Deadpool film (Disney/Marvel got the right back to xmen so the new ones should be better), but same world with a much different way of telling a story. A lot more comedy, especially at the studios. No spoilers so I won't say why I didn't give it a 5* but it's definitely worth watching more than once to catch everything.",4
100569,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"First: Overcoming the public expectation of this movie is impossible. It was always doomed to be heavily panned. I enjoyed the movie overall. Yes there were eye rolling moments- the fight scenes were a little eye rolling, some dialogue was dumb, naobis makeup looked terrible and I didn’t love the ending BUT I loved the overall plot. I liked the meta commentary and the throwbacks to the original . I am satisfied with matrix resurrection- which in some ways was a literal resurrection of the original movie. I won’t go into detail, but I enjoyed watching it and will watch again ",4
100570,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Really enjoyed. I found 1st 30 minutes a little confusing, but it helped the story later.  As some have said, this is a true love story and i feel empowering.  The action sequences are good, and not yoo much pointless action like past few installments. Interesting... is Trinity the one... Not tthe  best movie I have seen, but a very good movie about what matters in life. I can handle that.",4
100571,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I loved the original Matrix - one of my favorite movies as a young adult.  I really enjoyed the characters, plot etc.  Resurrections was entertaining, especially the idea of Neo caught in the matrix again as a creator of a game that was really his previous life.  My only problem with the film is in the end, while Neo is apparently blocking gun fire with his hands etc etc...why is it that Trinity is able to fly and save them both when she could never do that before?  That just confused me a bit. I thought he was the matrix super person.  Does no ones else find that odd?",3
100572,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Weak start. The second half picked up for me from the nostalgia of the first three movies. This movie didn't create a rise for me, it made me excited I get to see neo do his thing one more time, wasn't original. Neo and trinity have their stories put together and I will say they did a good job on how they were able to make that happen. Wish they used that effort for all the other little plot twists in the movie.
",3
100573,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Great, concept. Love the way they tried to tie in Alot of the old stuff.. the amount of time they spent on the video game creators thinking of ideas was really dumb and boring. I did enjoy when the story actually was moving at a decent pace. Which was more through the last half. But if they hadn't spent so much time in the beginning making that same point for so long. Yes we get it. He doesn't remember, blah blah. Then they could have spent more time explaining things in the end.. left me thinking..okay.. what happend to this person and what happend to this place and this doesn't feel like an ending at all.... kind of ruined the whole movie..",3
100574,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it. Something was missing, deeply, truly. It felt so disconnected and the backstory was drawn out and kinda nonsensical. The true action scenes were amazing but I wish the backstory was summed up quickly and then went into action. Perhaps the missing Wachoski's input would've helped. Overall not bad, but nothing special like I prayed for. I'm watching it again as I type bc I fell asleep..",3
100575,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,They should have procured the same Director. From 1998 till now this is the best we could do. Come on WD put your imagination.  To much color and Asian sites politically. Why not Italy Germany or India. I'm watching the original Matrix which is more SIFI back then.,3
100576,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,You can cut the movie to 3 parts ...first part building the story up(that is done really well)....second part showing the main issue or better to say the villain behind it all( eh ...could have been done better)...third part solving the main issue or problem( poorly done....) Through movie the start is really good and the end is like why warner bros is even trying....just like other movies like warnerbros justice league or first Wonder woman movie...overall it was fun to watch,3
100577,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Action scenes where a bit confusing. And as for the green tint, I understand the reason why it's gone because of the end of the 3rd movie... but I couldn't keep my mind of it. It's should be there to symbolise being in the matrix whether it be new or old. ",3
100578,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The best part of the movie was Carrie and Keanu. The acting was great, the dialogue and storyline were abysmally terrible. It was moderately entertaining, but a total cringeworthy mess of writing. I can honestly say they did this one dirty just like the new star wars movies. Hard pass on any future movies.",3
100579,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Something about it seems lacking. It does not have that ""Matrix"" vibe. Maybe it is the change of some important characters (including Agent Smith) or the plot but something is just lacking. However, I love how they added clips from the original trilogy and the graphics. So I give it 3 stars",3
100580,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I feel like I watched a full length tribute to the trilogy.  There is nothing fresh and new. If it wasn't for my interest in Keanu and Carrie, I'd hate this movie. It didn't really add anything to the series. It was a middle of the road, safe movie that, IMO, was a cash in on the nostalgia of the fan base.",3
100581,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Matrix was a game changer in the movie industry and this has nothing special. The cinematic of this lacks too much of everthing you would lokento see from such a great trilogy. The amount off BS like Trinity being able to fly just because with nothing solid behind it. I loved the trilogy, for me one of THE best Fantasy and special effects movie of its era. This should had been something else, its just not made by with a similar quality director or team as good outstanding movies. Just a money maker. Compare the goals of Galaxy Wars, the first 3 good had a great impact and the last 3 had a great distinction of graphics. Matrix, this isnt it.",2
100582,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Well, ok it's not going to be a 5 star, but I think new and younger audiences will enjoy it. However the more mature, thinking movie goer who has seen the 1st one, its never going to compete. As other reviewers have mentioned,  its lost that avant-garde cinematography with single frame sequences, the awe and wonderment, and kinda follows a lot of the marvel comic movie style. Most of all, what I feel it's lost is the Neo\Trinity chemistry. Acting is like a daytime soap romance, and the last scene resembled America Lampoon skit, as they both let out an awkward chuckle\laugh. ",2
100583,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I went into this with very low expectations, and they certainly delivered a movie worthy of a low review. This movie lacked any of the feel of the Matrix movies, no sense of urgency no nothing. Bad script writing with massive plot holes in it, horrible fight scenes. No, really horrible fight scenes. It was actually comical when you think about previous movies. The messages. All the messages. They could’ve just filmed someone holding big cue cards for us to read off of. They really went out of their way on that. No Agent Smith. Heck,they should’ve removed Neo and what little of Trinity we get to see. I’m trying to figure out why they even bothered making it. But I guess, all Hollywood can do is sequels, prequels and just out right remaking the whole movie to fit todays times.Don’t waste your time or money on this.

",2
100584,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I waited 18 yrs for that? What a let down! If I wanted to watch mediocre fight scenes and a frustratingly confusing storyline I could have stayed home and watch regular cable tv. I don’t understand why they would take the best and most exhilarating parts that the Matrix is known for and exclude them from this movie. I kept thinking any minute now something good is going to happen and I’ll get those feelings of excitement and chills I used to get while watching the Matrix. But as the minutes agonizingly ticked by it was clear whoever wrote this movie had no intentions of pleasing Matrix fans and only wanted to bore them to death. I probably saw the original Matrix movies in the theater 10+ times!!! I should have walked out of this movie I was so non entertained. Who signed off on this? They should be fired.,2
100585,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Really not that great. Cheap laughs in a film they didn't belong in... used to lighted the mood when it shouldn't have been light. Its vibe was an elaborate romance fan fiction that bastardized the underlying themes and conceptualization of the original film. It was clunky, felt washed up and served no purpose. The Matrix gained its status due to its philosophical undertones and well executed action scenes. This movie failed to uphold the initial vision and was lackluster kn both those fronts. I didn't go to the Matrix for some laughs. I went to get mind f***ed.",2
100586,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I was so hopeful that the long awaited 4th instalment of The Matrix series would be great. I was sadly disappointed. To me it was a wasted opportunity to really bring the story full circle and cement the franchise after two disappointing movies. I won't ruin the movie for anyone who is yet to see it with any spoilers. All I want to say is that there was so much potential to make a great chapter/end to a truly magnificent franchise starting with one of my all time favourites, The Matrix.",2
100587,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Definitely nostalgia bate.  The first half was not needed and slow,  no real build up to the action second half. The Matrix franchise was revolutionary it it use of inventive camera, action scenes and unusual character traits during fight scenes.   This was like a PG-13 Matrix game.  All the scenes play out mechanically and the characters are mild NPCs.  Monster uber mistake of not having Lawrence Fishbourne as a major player in the story.  We didn't need to wait 12 years for this.",2
100588,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Being a big fan of The Matrix movies had high expectation. I would call it rather disappointing possibly because i saw it expecting something out of the ordinary. Post 2 and half hours i seriously cant even think of a memorable scene in the movie except for ""Deja Vu"". It was the same repeat with different set of actors other than Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss. I think they really tried hard to give life to this new movie, and at the end of the movie i felt it was soulless! So if the first movie was the best - this i would recon would be the worst of the four.",2
100589,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,This movie was really good for the first half but failed to capture the essence of the matrix. It lacked any cohesive plot and was really grasping at straws towards the end. And if you were hoping for badass fight scenes you will be sadly disappointed but instead you will get what looks and feels like a group of matrix fanboys got together and decided to make a low budget matrix film and one dude got uncle Keanu reeves to help out. They completely neutered Neo. Only reason I’m giving it 2 star is because the first half crushed the feeling of being stuck in the matrix but being told you’re crazy.,2
100590,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The Matrix redone without any style or beauty . A hodgepodge of unmemorable music , bad lighting , quick cutting sloppy fight choreography mixed with shaky camera and flavorless gun fights . The CGI was on par with the originals from nearly two decades ago . Is that a good thing? It's one of the highlights of Matrix Resurrections sadly . Constant flashback's to scenes from the original movie look cheesy , it just screams this film can't stand on it's own . It's great to have some of the original cast together again , too bad the film didn't do them any justice . Thoroughly too long winded , the story isn't good enough to carry the film the kind of length we're forced to endure . In the end it looks like a made-for-tv movie , not a 190 million dollar film . Not recommended .",2
100591,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I’ve been waiting 20 years for this 💩 I have imagined this moment for a long time. Is it real? Unfortunately it was real 😔,1
100592,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Abysmal. Began with a relatively interesting idea of The Matrix being a game and a few knowing quips about remaking the same product before descending into an incomprehensible farce which resembled one of those dreadful pop videos which try to integrate scenes from a movie for which the band has recorded the soundtrack. These scenes from the original only served to remind me of how far superior it was. The rest was references to the original or scenes that resembled the popular scenes from the original, only broken up by long explanations which tried to clarify what was going on.  There was an enthusiastic girl with blue hair who ran around like a latter day Scrappy Doo, trying to enliven an old product for a young audience while a woman from one of the other movies did a terrible impression of an old woman. By the finale when people began throwing themselves out of windows, I knew how they felt. I will always love the original Matrix but this was bad, really bad.",1
100593,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Well....what a major disappointment. I was skeptical from the outset when I first saw this advertised. But being such a huge fan of the trilogy (as in I've watched these films back to back at least 30 times), I thought that ANY new matrix, is a good thing.....well how wrong I was. Put aside the awful plot that is riddled with holes and dead ends, the characters had zero depth, full of cheesy one liners and unnecessary commentary. They even managed to turn agent Smith (arguably one of the most sinister villains in film ever), into a joke. A jumped up American kid, with the voice of a child with the flu, and the presence of a small French poodle inside a fake gucci handbag....",1
100594,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Yeaahhhh, it really sucked. This movie felt like a YouTube channel made their own sequel. The plot starts out and you think it's going to be like the old movies where these events lead to other events and finally some grand and epic finale where it all comes together, but instead we have a rehashing of old idea that ultimately lead to one very unexciting scene and then the movie ends. It makes no sense to me. Did they use their whole budget on the cast and special effects? If covid is your excuse for making a garbage movie then maybe you should of just waited to make it.... I aaaaalmost went to the theater to watch this but thank GOD I didn't. I'm so sick of Hollywood's inability to take risks and make original, exciting content and instead just try to do what made them money in the past. matrix resurrections isn't even a good time on HBO and I found myself on my phone for most of it. The people raring this movie anything more than a single star are children who didn't grow up with good movies. If you have a brain you won't enjoy this movie.",1
100595,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"The best part of this movie is it’s callbacks to the previous 3. I’m disappointed with this movie for a multitude of reasons. The first is they nerfed Neo. Based on the plot, of course he needs to jog his memory to get back in the swing of things, however the writers apparently thought it just wouldn’t come to fruition. Next, in every fight scene there was multiple frames where you could clearly see a pause between blows. It was rigid and not very well choreographed, which is sad because the whole point of a 2021 remake is to explore with today’s CGI and special effects, neither of which were capitalized on. Also, the entire (was trilogy) was based on the development and savior principle of ‘The One’. In this remake they abandoned the very core of the story to make way for a new development. Overall the acting was good amongst the characters and I don’t think they should be remembered by a terrible failure courtesy of the writers, directors, and cinematographers. Leaving the movie open for a sequel to the reboot was drastically optimistic. Ultimately, I’m disappointed and far more impressed with The Matrix movies made in the 90’s than the cash grab film they composed. The actors and fans deserved a lot better.",1
100596,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I could have waited longer had I known this was gonna be hw end result! It felt rushed, it was confusing , and there was nothing at all groundbreaking or spectacular about this new fourth installment of the Matrix franchise! The special effects for average at best and the acting could have been aloy better, but I think that had to do with them not doing multiple takes for scenes, from what Keanu Reeves expressed in an interview! Normally after watching a movie I enjoyed I'd go and watch it a couple more times , or to see if I missed anything if I dozed off! Not this time , one and done! This movie was terrible and I think one of the BIGGEST sacrifices Keanu made for this movie other than just his reputation was that it looked like he shaved and cut his hair for this movie ta boot !",1
100597,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"Disappointing, they should have just left it, this is not the matrix revival that people wanted. The first 30 minutes was good before Neo wakes up, I liked how he was a game developer who thought he was crazy. I liked the added lore, and what happened after Resolutions, good CGI but that's about it. After when Neo wakes up, it was a snooze feast with long drawn out dialogue, stuff what we heard before in the original trilogy. The action was poor, too fast, shaky cam, couldn't tell what was going on, the original trilogy the action was perfect. I have seen better fight sequences on Netflix shows. They made the Merovingian into a joke character, well just like everything in the film. They got rid of agents for Humans with matrix coding eyes, who act like zombies. It wasn't made clear how the characters can get out of the matrix without a phone booth. Both Keanu and Carrie-Anne looked tired, their story is finished how about new main characters? Not two dead characters? I could go on, had some good ideas but poorly executed. Film is not canon, the Matrix awakens tech demo is more canon than this garbage.",1
100598,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,I've grown up with 5 uncles and a grandfather that are movie buffs!  And as a young one I watched some great films with them such as The Game. The book of Eli.. Aliens... Terminator. These movies I grew up watching and knowing were good with great actors of all kinds. I was very disappointed less then an hour in. Morpheus really disappointed me in this role.... He is the glue to it all besides neo. And the actor did not fulfill this role Nairobi either. It was just so lazily casted and rushed for some reason. The graphics and fight scenes in 1999 ....we're better then this 2021 movie... Smh.......A Wrinkle In Time had better graphics 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️,1
100599,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"I’m writing this as I watch it. Here’s a quote from the movie that sums up my thoughts so far, “Reboots sell.” I was so excited to watch this, I’ve been a fan of the matrix ever since I watched the first film with my dad. The first 5 minutes had tacky action sequences and they had to throw in the liberal rhetoric to boot. I will treat this the same way I treat the Star Wars sequels: when I need a good laugh I’ll turn it on. Keanu Reeves told his fans that he’ll continue making Matrix films as long as they want it so as a fun I’m telling you to stop. DO NOT make another Matrix.",1
100600,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,Action/Sci-fi,"It’s a movie with Keanu about the matrix but I’m not counting it as part of the family with the 3 matrix films that precede this movie. This film is it’s own separate fantasy. There’s no dystopian element whatsoever. The new characters have this flamboyant cadence and doogie howser is so over the top in this. There’s a line in it around 20 minutes in to the effect that Warner bros is going to make this film with or without Keanu and company. It’s in reference to a game within the movie but it’s a blatant tell about how this movie was going to be produced one way or another. It’s slow, it’s boring, it’s full of ridiculous plot twists that somehow has everything to do with Neo and Trinity rediscovering each other against all odds. I really looked forward to seeing this movie. It’s trailer was amazing but unfortunately it is where this film’s climax lies. I wish I had more thumbs but I’ve just got the two and The Matrix Resurrections gets both pointing down",1
100601,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This was actually an amazing movie. I had been putting it off because of various reviews I had heard with very contradicting opinions. However, I am so glad I did watch it because it has made its way onto my top 5 marvel movies. The action in this movie was INCREDIBLE the attention to detail was amazing and The characters were so diverse. It was good to see all the characters work together as a family dynamic. This movie was emotional fun and action packed. I would recommend this movie to anyone whether its a marvel fan or someone who is new to marvel you don't need much background marvel knowledge. And Harry's mid-credit scene was sooo good I really do hope there is an Eternals 2 because I feel like there is so much more to explore.",5
100602,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This is one of marvels best movies in my opinion. The cast, characters, director, cinematography, plot, everything, was beautifully done and came together well. I never felt like the movie was slow or lagged, and thought the plot progressed at a good pace— there was just enough background story to establish characterization, and time for the audience to build attachments to the characters. The history and diversity of the characters was incredible and well done. The actors did great, and the wonderful director did fantastic pulling this compelling story together. I usually favor more “gritty” marvel movies like Captain America The Winter Soldier or Black Widow, but the eternals has risen to my top 5 favorites. It explores new ideas and challenges the audience, which is exciting. I can’t wait to watch it again, and I can’t wait to see the eternals in their next movie.",5
100603,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Despite what the specialised critics are saying, Eternals is a beautiful journey through Marvel's Universe origins. Chloé Zhao brought to MCU her artistic style, which bring to this massive franchise a new breeze.Even though the picture has 10 main characters interacting in the screen, they all work as one persona, and we have the feeling they are all well explored in their individual complexities. Highlight to Sprite and Gilgamesh, that present beautifully sensibility and depth.",5
100604,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,You've got to watch it for yourself....It's an emotional rollercoaster...reminding us of how beautiful and heartbreaking humanity can be at it's worst and best.... absolutely captivating! Layers of character development and reveals unexpected....The Gods with all their powers are flawed beings too....Humanity has great influence to change the outcome of our very existence. We are powerful than we realize! I so loved it I can't wait for Eternal 2 ....ok seriously though was anyone wandering  Dane Whitman( I miss you Jon Snow lol) was gonna go full superhero and go after Sersi. At Any rate it's an experience.... love all the characters it's hard not to love them and everything they bring.,5
100605,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"SPOILORS UP AHEAD! This was an Incredible movie, Even if u don't like Super heros like us, You still might like it! I mean depending on ur personality.....Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Makkari (Lauren ridloff) I wish they had showed there connection between the two more but it was Great! When You See it in theaters and or at home Make sure you Stay for the after credit seens. I Personally loved the Character Sprite (Lia Mchugh) She Just Seemed like such a great Character!! Obviously I also loved Makkari (Lauren Ridloff)  And I love how they included Icarus Flying into the sun I mean Obviously it wasn't good but you get what I Mean. But Overall I loved this Movie So So Much, And The Action Scenes were Just Incredible!",5
100606,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Ahead of it's time. I've seen it twice in IMAX now and besides the 2 foreshadowing cameos I don't know why people still have questions. Everything is explained thoroughly, and repeated neatly in some cases during the movie. Ten characters can be hard to introduce in one film but Chloe Zhao works her magic into the Marvelverse so well here. This was my big doubt going into the film for the first time. As usual, we see her accentuate the imperfections and inner turmoils of our protagonists, and even our antagonists are filled with purpose and direction by the end of the second act. As usual, expect amazing visuals. These characters are soaked in golden hour lighting and each deliver heavy, but impressively not tiresome dialogue. Not to say the film doesn't supply a few chuckles. The settings are mostly historic, lived-in locations that you can really feel the presence of. Green screen fills the obvious scenes with stellar designs like some type of Hubble Telescope fantasy. History buffs will appreciate that they show ancient artifacts relative to each character during the credits. Two post-credits scene, and I love how the second one worked into the film. Both of these scenes aren't explained, as to keep us jazzed for the future, in true MCU fashion. I feel that this film addressed every complaint I've ever heard about Marvel movies ""not being real cinema"". One of my top 5 Marvel films for sure. Take notes, Scorsese.",5
100607,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"What are the critics on about? This is a great movie. It may have been slow at the start but it is what is needed to set the foundation and the story and action picks up as the film progresses. Though all are new characters and we have just met them the first time, they were able to give each one of them a storyline from which we, the audience, can come to care for these characters. I was moved by what each Eternal had to go through. I believe the reason why the critics gave this movie such bad ratings is because there was so much expectation from the build up of the film as well as the many heavyweight stars included. But seriously, if the critics gave Guardians of the Galaxy a glowing review, it is only because there was zero expectation from that movie and the decent storyline came out a pleasant surprise. Bring on Eternals Part 2!",5
100608,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Definitely not your usual MCU movie, but no less worthy of praise. This movie is in a league of its own! I'm so intrigued with the world of the Eternals. Some might say it was too draggy but I thought it was right for Zhao to take her time unpacking heavier themes and introducing so many characters. And besides, I'm sure MCU fans are not unfamiliar with long run-times and ensemble casts?? The world-building was beautiful and so interesting, and I only wish we could have got to know some characters better. Go in with an open mind and you will be rewarded - beautiful mise-en-scene, cinematography and awesome fight scenes!!!!",5
100609,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This is one of the best movies I’ve seen in a while. It was long, but engrossing all the way through. Funny without being cheesy or trying too hard. And the plot took a few twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. It definitely wasn’t predictable if you’re not already familiar with the source material, which I’m not. My favorite part was the characters. Each one was unique and made you either love them, hate them, or both at the same time. It’s hard to have an ensemble movie introducing all the characters for the first time and have them all feel fully fleshed out, but this movie does it.",5
100610,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This movie was superb, this movie uncovered the universe of marvel. The characters were so awesome and enjoyable to watch. The CGI was really well done as well especially the deviants they looked and acted like a threat. And then the big bad torwards the end icarus was amazing especially the fights between the fastest speedster alive and icarus. It reminded me of dragon ball super and Z of how fast and impactful the fighting was. The story paced very well not once did it feel overwhelming or slow. As it was very astonishing and captivating even the moments where the characters would have building and bonding moments. I have to say this was a well deserved movie and enjoyable 10/10 again by marvel.",5
100611,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Going into this film, I knew it had to tackle a lot of the bigger ideas of MCU Lore (Celestials, Eternals ofc, origins of their universe ext) and given the levity of ALL characters involved,  I think Chloe did a very great job of not just shining light on these characters individually, more so together as a family dynamic that spanned thousands of years up to this point in the MCU.  For Comics Fan, their us definitely clear inspiration from Kirby and even some of the newer iterations, but even the hardest of Kirby fans know that to accept everything the Eternals have to offer in one sitting is impossible haha. Each eternal had their role and personalities showed in a way that we understand their development over said thousands of years. This movie doesn't follow the typical ""MCU Formula"" but I would say it definitely shares it's DNA. From beginning to end, it almost felt like a phase 1 movie, setting the foundations for these characters that a lot of people already are enjoying and in sure will pop up here and there in projects to come. Unlike Shang-Chi, this movie doesn't have an Avenger pop up to make it feel ""all connected"", but this movie does something even nicer, sets up prominent  Characters to come! All the expositions is necessary, but was not a drag if you enjoy following character development through said exposition. Very pleased with my initial viewing and I'm looking forward to watching it again 🙌🏾",4
100612,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I saw Eternals for the first time yesterday night and am happy to report that the poor critics reviews are not actually representative of the film itself. Eternals is a great time, but probably a great time you’d only want to have once, because some scenes are just so unnecessarily long. The cinematography and visuals are brilliant - as expected from Chloé Zhao – but sometimes there’s just too much of it when the plot could be moving along. The movie excels in doing many things – it’s action sequences are top notch (though few and far between), the CGI is great, the characters are all fleshed out and given enough time to be introduced, some good gags and the story features some excellent twists and huge stakes. The representation, I don’t care what anyone else says, is also very well handled with a diverse cast, first deaf mcu superhero and first gay superhero, all of which is handled very organically. What the movie gets wrong is just being too long, too many conversations between characters that weren’t needed, too many drawn out landscape shots or flashbacks, but overall it’s a great world-building film that adds a lot to the MCU, it’s just not one that I see myself returning to as often as I would say Shang Chi or Black Widow. Good end credit scenes x2. 7/10",4
100613,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Eternals: Ever wonder about different groups of Meta-Humans, Demi-Gods etc who inhabit the MCU yet don't seem to impact on each other until it's time for a new film complicating the timeline and Canon? Never mind, just sit back, relax and enjoy the fun. The Eternals are sent to Earth to protect humans against the Deviants, predatory monsters. Arriving in Mesopotamia in 5000 BC they battle the Deviants using killer eye-beams, super strength etc. The locals are a plucky bunch though and menace the Eternals with spears so Druig (Barry Keoghan) has to control their minds, those minds and hearts are soon won with gifts. Throughout history the Eternals battle the monsters, we them in Babylon (complete with hanging gardens) in 575 BC, in Gupta, 400AD. They have a sort of Prime Directive not to interfere in human conflicts and this especially causes problems for Druig when he sees the Conquistadors slaughtering Aztecs in 1521. But they do nudge technological development along with inventions by Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), I'm not saying it's Aliens but... Anyway after a 500 hiatus the Deviants return so the Eternals must assemble once more. I'm always expecting Ikaris (Richard Madden) to say See You Jimmy in his Scottish accent as he headbutts a monster. Thena (Angelina Jolie) forms weapons from cosmic energy but (like a Limerickian) is likely to stab anyone due to her demented state (Mahd Wy'ry). There are ten Eternals in total with numerous other characters. A coupe of interesting plot twists add to the intrigue. An action drama with a fine vein of humour. Directed and Co-written by Chloé Zhao. 8/10.",4
100614,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Whilst the plentiful use of monologue and complex and at some times convoluted plot may dampen the experience for some, The Eternals is a testimony to future things to come in the MCU, giving us the greatest look into the past that the MCU has had since Guardians of The Galaxy, and also a double dose of what to look forward to in the future. An extensive look into the history and origins or the universe and earth is ever present throughout the film, perhaps too much for some people liking, but for fans hoping for more theories and branches to the MCU, perhaps not enough and perhaps opening more doors of opportunity and confusion than the MCU and it’s fans were ready for. The action sequences speak for themselves, beautifully crafted and choreographed, emotionally charged at points, and full of surprise and tension. Perhaps more than other MCU entries to date, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat. For some, the action may not be frequent enough, but it can only be agreed upon that when it is there, it is brilliant. Plot holes do loom in the film but not to an extent that harshens the progression of the film, however some unanswered questions and odd behaviour do complicate the plot from a viewers perspective, but it is nothing that the film gets stuck in the mud over. The visuals and cinematography live up to what you expect from the trailer with fabulous scenery and eye catching sets, The Eternals does not fade away from being extravagant. The film does a sound job developing character and gives wonderful unique aspects to all of its large ensemble, mixing comedy with tragedy, and action with recount. It is safe to say, for those who enjoy the intricacies of a shared universe, this film will be very satisfying. It is safe to say that fans of the cosmic MCU will be pleased. And it is safe to say that fans of the emotional and character side of the MCU will walk away with glee. But for those who may find it all a bit too over the top, or long, or slow at times, The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming. Marvel Studios: The Eternals, 8.5/10.",4
100615,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I'll be honest, you're getting deep into the Marvel universe with this one and a lot will feel like it's rushed because of how big these characters are and where the roots originate from, so you have to understand with such big characters you're goin to get a big climatic feel. It didn't matter to me that the cast was diversed, I thought the actors alone worked well together, my friend Evan who I went to see Eternals with, would keep telling me how proud he was of the Gilgamesh character, a strong Asian american who he felt had no limits. Evan did end up crying when Gilgamesh was killed by a deviant, and quickly started to chant justice for Gilgamesh. So all in all some people will have this connection with the diverse cast, me not so much, but I can understand why someone would. ",4
100616,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Yes, it's long, but it never felt dull to me. There are a lot of characters with kinda silly names, but they were all well-developed, and likeable. This isn't a fun, superhero-smash film; it's quite heavy in places, pretty emotional, and with more focus on character over plot. But there was still humour throughout, cool action pieces, and I felt the whole thing tied together well. As others have mentioned, the task of introducing so many ideas and characters into an already bloated world was going to be a hard one, but I think Eternals does a pretty good job.",4
100617,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Wow I was surprised that I liked this movie. The trailers and characters never sparked my attention before watching. But I found myself enjoying most of the eternals throughout the movie like druig, makkari, kingo, and gilgamesh (my favorites) there relationships felt real the cosmos aspect of the celestials was awesome and Ikaris plot twist while I understand the hate worked for me it made sense as he was facing a moral dilemma between his family and his creator which was fascinating. The only problems were that the third act was wonky, deviants weren't interesting enough, and sersi, thena, and ajak weren't intresting enough or needed more time dispite this it was a really good movie. Sure it was mid tier MCU but really good overall and better than a good amount of other movies. so Eternals gets a 7.5 out of 10",4
100618,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Definitely not your “average” Marvel film and I think that’s why I like it it’s refreshing it’s not the same story line like the Marvel movies that came before it. It establishes the direction Marvel is moving in. Its captivating, dramatic, funny, and exciting. It’s funny to me that people could hate on this movie so much what’s worse is the only people who seem to have an issue with this movie is how they put it “huge Marvel fans” who you think would be excited for the growth of their “favorite” franchise but alas they’d rather trash it for being different and inclusive which sounds similar to the way a lot of “die hard” fans felt about Black panther when it first was released and just goes to show how toxic this fandom can be. Sorry for ranting but overall the movie is great definitely worth the watch.",4
100619,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Honestly, I don't know why people think this film is bad.This is a very well planned film with many new characters coming to the MCU including the long awaited Celestials. I recommend this film because it has a very good plot, great music to fit each character, and many surprising twists and cliff hangers that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. Not to mention that this movie is set all across history which I find is one great technique used in this film. The only problem I have with this movie is that it is a long movie so if you have a lot of time on your hands, definitely watch this film, it is worth it.",4
100620,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I love movies and have always enjoyed Marvel movies.  I couldn’t wait to see Eternals opening day (majority of the reason I’m a HUGE Angelina Jolie fan!) The movie was beautiful and mesmerizing to the eyes! The special effects were amazing! I read a few not so favorable reviews and am so happy that did not deter me, the director Cloe Zhao did a great job with the diverse cast. It was refreshing to see the different aspects and backgrounds of these super beings. The post credit scene with Harry Styles was icing on the cake! Cannot wait for Eternals 2!!",4
100621,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The movie was visually stunning, and it isn’t your typical Marvel movie. It was not my cup of tea because I wish they did a better job introducing the characters and establishing relationships. I didn’t feel connected to most of them, and most of them barely had lines. I did love Druig though, very confident and lively character!",3
100622,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Still processing it, honestly. If I had to use a word to describe it, it would be “meh”. I personally found the first half of the movie  quite boring, really heavy and slow, the characters are not really convincing and the story isn’t developed linearly. The constant flash backs give a feeling of confusion. Then it abruptly changes the pace and the story becomes more interesting, they probably remembered they were shooting a Marvel movie so they got back on track. Neither the worse nor the best one.",3
100623,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,This movie has a lot of heavy hitter stars. Even stars burn out and it’s what’s happening to Salma and Angelina. The creativeness of the movie is amazing. Great cast! Ikarus  character felt like DC’s Superman.  It was a brilliant movie just not Marvel Material.  It was a bad introduction of the Eternals to the Marvel Universe.,3
100624,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I found this movie to be the most boring Marvel movie. I felt the cast did amazing with the material they had. I think Marvel went against the formula that has worked for all Marvel movies. The writing was just boring in my opinion, the action lacked, the soundtrack was nothing to rave about, but the thing I missed was the one comic relief character. I think Kumail Nanjiani tried, but the writing was just not there. I won’t say the movie was terrible, because I stayed awake the whole time, but it was a disappointment for a Marvel movie. I normally will watch Marvel movies multiple times in the theater, but sadly this one I feel is a one and done.",3
100625,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I am a huge Marvel fan and was thinking that this did not feel like your typical Marvel movie.  Where is the Marvel humor and wonderful score of music?  OK movie but could of been so much better, just didn’t seem like I was watching a Marvel movie.  Marvel has always been good in brining Comecon some very serious moments, but here they were just too zero.  Was entertaining.",3
100626,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,A good film in my opinion but i wish they focused more on details because the point of the eternals was to protect the humans from the deviants because the deviants were feeding on them meanwhile  tiamut the celestial who was meant to emerge from earth needed the population too be big in order to feed so my point is when thanos snapped and for 5 years half the population blipped didnt it mean tiamut couldnt feed properly in order for the emergence to occur why didnt the eternals interfer since their main job was helping celestials emerge like what arishem told sersis about ajak that she has helped  alot of celestials emerge over differnet planets meanwhile ajak too didnt interfer when earths population was cut in half and also when tiamut was going to emerge  before sersis stopped him why didnt doctor strange interfere since doctor strange is the protector of earth for example in thor ragnarok when thor came to earth with loki doctor strange caught loki in a time loop and told thor he protects earth from all threats and loki is considered one so tiamut emerging wouldve been the end of all life on earth and earth it self but doctor strange didnt make an appearance in eternals or any of the sorcerers like wong who apprently is sorcerer supreme since doctor strangle blipped for 5 years wong became sorcerer supreme and his duty is  protecting earth i get that the other avengers are in space like thor and the guardians of the galaxy and nick fury has been off planet for a while now but doctor strange is still on earth post spiderman no way home,3
100627,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Overall, it was a very original movie for the MCU that gives SOME important background points. It had a  lot of irrelevant scenes that felt like they were trying a little too hard. They also should have incorporated more of the MCU, maybe some clips of them watching the snap occur or something. Kind of a let down as the cosmic world of the MCU has so much potential.",3
100628,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I love marvel! This movie, however, felt almost like it was a marvel knock off movie. It just felt a bit empty. It was hard to connect to the characters, I barely cared about what happened to them. The script felt bland and almost random at times. It had some cool fighting scenes and an overall good intention. Hence, 3 stars for me. I would not recommend but I didn't hate it completely.",3
100629,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"It was ok. The story line was meh, I think some Atheists undertones for sure. Two people barely with clothes on kissing and  rolling in the dirt. Two black guys kissing..just unnecessary stuff from marvel in my opinion. The story line was ok but kinda of opposite of the title because the eternals kept dying, like wth.. should be called mortals lol. Love all the rest.",3
100630,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Was okay. Better than I expected for the most part. However, I did expect a bit more, like more of a physical tie in to other MCU characters of people we know of. Felt rushed and fast paced in the middle of the film, but definitely got better towards the end. Very nice film.",3
100631,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"My family and I gave this film a half-hour of our lives, then turned to something else. The movie may have gotten better, but the first 30 minutes were so dull, boring and pointless, we had no intention of spending another 2 hours watching. The opening action scenes in which various nameless protagonists were fighting generic CGI monsters was poorly executed. Watching charectors we've never heard of or seen before fight generic CGI monsters by using lasers and random powers is not intriguing or even interesting. You dont care if they win or loose because you dont even know who or what any of them are. When fans got behind the first Marvel movies, the charectors in those movies had personality, unique drive, and actual story arc. The charectors in this film seem to all be the same charector being portrayed by different actors and actresses. Angelina Jolie is playing her usual self when she plays the hero and as a result, her charector seemed to be fairly 2 dimensional. Overall, it's a bad idea to introduce so many charectors at the same exact moment in a film, the writing was weak, and the director I'm sure was doing nothing more than being ran by the producers and the actors themselves. These charectors may be fine in supporting roles down the line, but as stars of a stand alone film, this just didn't work for me.",2
100632,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Three star at best but I as a die hard Marvel fan give it a 2, let me tell you why. The story starts of like a trailer instead of a movie and has 2 not one superhero line up scenes, where they stand in a v-shaped position. Like why, it's so cringy. Then we move on with a narration to bring the scene into present day. The earth is preparing for the emergence and they start gathering all the superheroes because they split up during the 7000 years. 2 hours and 10 mins just went to them regathering, that was so unnecessary, they did that and didn't even develop the characters like the only ones who had personality was Kingo and Karun, the rest were very boring and had no personality, they all had the same. the last fight scene with the evolved deviant was such a waste, they could done so much with the deviant. And let me tell you this was most definitely not a smart choice on Marvels hand to make a different type of movie like this. At most the length of this movie could have been 1 hour and 30 mins, the rest would of been cut on the cutting board. I've Shang-Chi the day before, it was wonderful, they had character development, plot, and emotions but in this movie there was none of that. instead just watch  Dune, it is on the top ten movies I've ever watched. Or watch Shang-Chi.",2
100633,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"You people who are giving it a five star and “absolutely love the film!” Know nothing about cinema. The story and dialogue was so bad, marvel tries to push comedy way too much. All for it to be foul comedy. The only thing I will give them are the visuals. These studios are hiring weak writers because they know people that don’t even know about film are gonna watch the movie and love it just because it’s marvel. Marvel is truly going down and you can really tell they’re doing it all for the money and not for the fans.",2
100634,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,I believe this one of the weakest Marvel movies thus far. Story has more plot holes then Swiss cheese. They explain why they can’t intervene and why they did not help when Thanos attacked but intervene throughout the film. To many cliché movie subplots and in places too forced to ensure all boxes are checked. This is not a bad movie but it is just not a good one either. Does not fit in the marvel universe like every other movie has. Please watch for yourself as all things are personal perspective and enjoyment comes to those who search for it in film.,2
100635,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I read this film was not great, but I watched it  anyway and was extremely disappointed. It was very flat, some of the dialogue was terrible, the overall feel was lacking something. The movie had some great actors in it, so I was surprised. I love most of the marvel movies  which seem to improve with each movie, but this one was a massive step backwards for me. I usually don't look at my watch during a movie, but this one had me several times. Endgame was longer, but I was entertained for the whe movie. Hopefully the sequel, if there is one will be much better.",2
100636,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Decent enough Marvel filler. Raises then lightly steps over some pertinent questions (“Where were you during the Thanos situation?” “We were told not to interfere in human conflict.” Sooo there weren’t a bunch of aliens threatening half of all existence, just humans. Gotcha), proffers some odd internal character logic and motivations, and paints a generally generic plot and picture. However — and *spoiler* somebody’s about to be mad — but I’m tired of black characters being used for diversity bingo. The ONE black character, and he’s gay. Why is it always us? Why are we the default? It’s like, hey, what’s the fastest, easiest, cheapest way to tick all the representation boxes? We know: get a black character and make them gay! See, everybody’s happy!",2
100637,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"A disappointing combination of wooden acting, poor casting, slow story telling and a complete lack of classic 'heart' moments to connect the audience with the characters resulted in a wholly underwhelming and disappointing film.  This was always going to happen when you try and whizz through 7000 years of stories and 10 main characters and would have been much better suited to a wandering Disney+ series where each characters motivation and story could have been explored properly. ",2
100638,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I watched this on my 45 inch tv on Disney+ I was really looking forward to watching it but I struggled at times to see what was going on as it was so dark. I could early see faces of the characters for at least half of the movie, it was clearly made for the big screen in a very dark room, I suggest watching at night with the lights out. Some of the characters were really good but I found a few of them rather bland and irritating, I don’t know at what point Harry Styles was in it as I missed him completely, maybe part of the really dark scenes. I will try and watch it again this evening with the lights out to see if there is any difference, it’s such a shame that so many new things a filmed so dark you can’t even see actors faces these days, maybe producers could consider this that movies/series are mostly watched on a smaller screen",2
100639,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The movie was OK at best. I love super hero movies and MCU has made some amazing movies. This movie in particular feels like it is lacking something and has a lot going on at the same time. I personally think that some of the scenes could totally be avoided and the plot would have still made sense. The sex scene at the front half of the movie, I felt was overemphasized, they could have just implied that. And there were too many exposition dump. The person I went to see the movie dozed off quite a few times and they like MCU movies. All in all they could have made the movie a lot better. Hope the second one will live up to the hype.",2
100640,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"(Mild Spoilers) So I am a HUGE Marvel fan, I re-watch all of these movies every year, so I really wanted to love this film but I jut couldn’t. I am so disappointed in this movie. It was my second most anticipated Marvel movie this year. The characters were the ONLY good thing about this film, I enjoyed almost every character. I did not like Sprite, because I found it creepy that she was into Ikaris. I see a lot of people saying that this is the most beautiful marvel movie, and I couldn’t disagree more, I still fill that Avengers Age of Ultron is a way better looking movie. The post credit scenes were just disappointing. Overall I’m sad to say that this is the worst Marvel movie so far. (Yes worst than Thor The Dark World.)",2
100641,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I was extremely disappointed for many reasons. The first is that Marvel movies are typically something I want to watch with my entire family and with my children being younger I can’t in good conscience let them watch this filth. The next reason for my disappointment is the chaotic sort of ADD of the film. I can’t even quite place why, and for that I am sorry. Normally I am very much able to point out specially what is wrong but in this case I can’t. The acting was sound and so was the cinematography. I think possibly the writers may have been to focused on being woke at time instead of letting the story develop…. Maybe I’m just being unfair. But something was off a bit. The last reason I am disappointed is in that as a Christian I was disappointed in the blatant homosexuality and open sexuality in the film. Another issue was the hint at Pedophilia. All and all probably my last Marvel and possibly Disney movie ever. The world is getting sick and morally vacant, with Hollywood as the vessel to our living room.",1
100642,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I was put off by the bland acting of the leads.. so boring to watch. Cersi had no chemistry at all with the male lead. The story was weird too,, too much love scenes for an action or marvel movie. I wish Angelina was the lead, her acting is on point..she steals the show. Druig actor chews his words its hard to understand what he is saying. The story is erratic. Even the final fight scene,, from subduing Icaris to switching to the deviant..weird. Also when you think the story couldnt get any lamer.. wait till the end when and a poor cg elf pops out with a gay looking Harry Styles in a cape…☠️☠️☠️☠️ A very disappointing Marvel film.",1
100643,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I was a huge marvel fan but this latest movie is just a complete waste of time. The plot/storyline is all over the place and ALL the characters are totally wooden and just don't gel. It's a tangled web of garbage from start to finish and it's obvious the most important aspect when putting this movie together was to concentrate on not upsetting the snowflakes and being politically correct. More focus was put on making sure we had the obligatory mix of cultures in the cast, with no one race missed out and of course the obligatory gay couple to keep the the 'others' happy. Sorry Marvel movies are just getting worse and worse, thank god I didn't actually pay to say this rubbish..",1
100644,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"A shameless cash grab, trying to catch the eye of everybody and anybody with an  ethnically diverse cast and some LGBTQ2+ connotations, but with a story that does not make any sense (even for MCU). A boring mish mash of old legends and misplaced humour. The limp pacing only surpassed by laughable acting from the very celebrity actors (Salma and Angelina) brought in to boost the box office. A pile of plot holes and chaotic action scenes…The love story between main characters supposed  to  make us root for them has no chemistry and makes no sense after it is revealed that they are in fact “fancy robots ”. It ruined MCU for me …",1
100645,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"What I think is that this movie is trash, the director isn't made for MCU movies, they wasted valuable minutes just by making the character stand in the ground and giving pose, The movie is just too much too much talk, didn't understand what arshem was saying thus bad editing in sound effects and too much information which literally takes away the movie , couldn't understand how the unified together, if stopping the celestial was so easy what's the point. No character indepth. Worst movie ever to be produced by marvel. How could they even accepted the pitch from the director and writers are trash and was out of mind when writing.  Marvel didn't care about this movie at all.  Money cannot make a Good movie it showed. Kevin fiege should be asked how could he let such a bad movie come out",1
100646,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This is a kid's movie, for a time I thought I am watching ben10. The expectation was too high for this movie. So many star actors worked here but feels like everyone is a superhero and no one can defeat them. Flying, getting invisible, making things fly or whatnot. they can do anything. A small GOT reunion was there as well. A major female role's name was Sersi and it felt so hilarious. Waste of time.",1
100647,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"The plot went nowhere. The deviants played no important role and they continuously dragged them in the plot for no reason. They also kept doing “flashbacks” which messed with the order and the attention span of the viewer. The ending and overall outcome was terrible. Also they should have focused on other characters instead of Sersi and Ikaris. The only thing that I liked about the movie was Thena, Gilgamesh and Makkari. I could care less about any of the other characters. I was excited to see Salma Hayek but she rarely got screen time so I also didn’t care much about her character. They depowered them so much that the only competent ones were Ikaris, Thena, and Gilgamesh when it came to protecting from the deviants. The characters and plot were wasted tremendously. It seems the people that directed this movie cared more about the propaganda they were trying to force such as making a originally STRAIGHT character gay instead of the actual movie. I had high expectations for this movie and I was genuinely excited so it was  quite disappointing to see how bad it was.",1
100648,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"This movie was awful. Casted washed up actors to try and get more people to watch it rather than make a genuinely good movie. It was boring for the most part, the characters didn’t make sense, and the creators completely threw the comics out. It doesn’t follow the comics even a little bit other than the minute long post credit scene. Ikaris’ ending made no sense whatsoever and Marvel at this point is trying to appease the public and use wokeness to gain attention instead of continuing to create good films. I normally love Marvel films but this was not good at all. It is not worth the time or money. This movie made me wish it never existed and my favorite part was when it ended.",1
100649,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"Overall a disappointing movie. I love the actors but they killed off the best character!! Also Salma was barely in the movie, the whole movie I spent waiting for Angelina Jolie to pop off but she was just sad the whole movie. There were so many characters that I didn't care what happened to them. Kit Harrington was good in all his scenes they were funny. I really expected more! Also the movie is WAY TOO LONG, they repeat a lot of the plot over and over, it was a confusing plot as well. SO far out of all the new phase of marvel movies, Black Widow was the best! Hopefully Marvel can improve the next movies cause I miss good Marvel movies!! Btw the best seen was the Bollywood scene no doubt.",1
100650,Eternals,2021,Action/Fantasy,"I just watched Eternals and it was awful and an absolute yawn fest. I'm quickly writing this to warn others so they don't lose 2 and a half hours of their lives like I just did. Think the first cgi Hulk movie in 2003. Think Apocalypto. It's hype and a void left by Avengers that fans are craving for. Mediocre to poor acting, overlong, with shady effects at times. I kept curling up on the cinema seat trying to get some kip in the hope that I'd wake up later when the movie gets better, except it doesn't. Beware, dear reader. Beware!",1
100651,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"An absolute must-see movie. The CGI is impeccable, the acting phenomenal, and it is not afraid to kill off some major characters. And just an FYI, Zendaya literally has three lines in the movie, so do not expect much from her. Timothée Chalamet, on the other hand, is truly gifted for his acting talent and deserves an award. Also, I HIGHLY recommend watching this movie in the theater. Try to refrain from watching Dune at home because the amazing cinematography is greatly elevated on the big screen. The complex plot of Dune is also a major strength of this movie, however, being someone who has not read the books or seen any of the old movies, I was a little lost. Make sure to watch some youtube videos explaining the backstory before watching this film; it will definitely help. Also, I went into the theater having no clue how long the movie was, so for that reason, it seemed to drag on. So just so everyone knows, this movie is 2 hours and 35 minutes long, and it really feels like more, so be prepared. Also, turns this was only part one of Dune, which I wish I would have known before watching it. But overall, this is a very well done movie, and I am excited to see part two!!! 5/5 stars",5
100652,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Definitely a slower paced and more serious movie but it's still great. Has a lot of world building and storytelling but it's still a very engaging movie throughout. Part of the experience is learning about this new Dune ""universe"". Me and my girlfriend both commented after the movie that it felt like the shortest 2 1/2 hour movie we ever watched and neither of us had read the book. If you enjoyed the new BladeRunner or the original LOTR movies then you'll love this new Dune. A nice change of pace from the increasingly repetitive StarWars/Avengers movies. We were surprised when we saw how many people hated this movie and found it boring/didn't understand it and we're definitely not movie snobs (I'll watch virtually anything). ",5
100653,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I have been a fan of Dune for a very long time. This movie was everything i had hoped for and more. The actors did a brilliant job. Each faction was portrayed fantastically. the sets and locatations were amazing. I was looking for small details, and was ready to nitpic, but i could not find fault. I was so happy the movie was done right i almost cried. So many of my favorite books have been done dirty in the movies but this one was great! I am so looking forward to Part 2! I cannot wait. If you have not seen DUNE, GO SEE IT.",5
100654,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I have read all of the Dune books by Frank Herbert and his son Brian. I was skeptical about going to this. I watched Villeneuves Blade Runner which was a spectacular visual film but the pacing and character development were painfully slow. Dune on the other hand, with Zimmers soundtrack, quick pace, phenomenal cast, really beautiful costuming (stunning) and very detailed layered sets make this film a stand out! Wow, a film like this comes along in a lifetime. Great filmmaking returns to the screen. The movie adheres to the narrative. It matched and then exceeded my experience of reading the books. The theater was packed and it was silent, waiting for the plots every twist to play out in anticipation. Most stayed to watch the credits roll. What a reward after so many months inside and a job expertly done. Can’t wait for the sequel.",5
100655,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Personally I don't enjoy movies, at all. From the moment I heard of this unique film I was hooked and ready to dive into the amazing plots and twists I knew it would have. From the moment it began to the very moment the credits rolled it had me glued to my seat ready to devour what was left, I honestly almost cried when I heard there will hopefully be a part two. The main characters are amazing, the scripts and the story itself was beyond amazing. The world needs more movies such as Dune, but I am certain I will be one of the first to watch this in the theaters in 2023, definitely worth two hours!",5
100656,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I absolutely loved the movie! We watched it this evening and I was more than surprised. I can’t remember a time that I watched a sci-fi film that grabbed me within the first three minutes. Usually it takes a really long time. But the second time I watch them, I’m in it. This one, if I may steal the cliché, “had me at hello“. I am middle-aged and my partner is a little more aged, lol. He read these books in his 20s. And talked me into watching this tonight.  He talked me into it more because I could tell it was something he really wanted to watch and watch with me. Pretty sweet. I love him. Lol. This time, he picked a good one! Lol. ",5
100657,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"The greatest thing about watching this movie, or having read the books, is knowing that it came before Star Wars was ever created. Majority of 1-star reviews I've read seem to have disapproved due to story-line and similarity to what's been done before. But the book was first published in 1965, the movie coming in 84'. The creation of a new movie wasn't to tell a new story or introduce unknown concepts. It was to make a well-made (with the incredible technology that we now have), worthwhile rendition of this story. The world of Dune is similar to Star Wars because that's how the author created it back in the 60's when first coming up with the idea. They aren't going to change that nor the plot-line just because other films since have used similar ideas. The story is already written. The film is only here to tell it. ",5
100658,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Finally a sci-fi franchise that hasn't been butchered by political agenda, bad writing and story telling, profit driven decisions and cultural engineering and wasted budgets. Dune 2021 is the benchmark now that puts the trash of franchise killers to shame. This does everything right that the rest does wrong. After the rubbish of the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, Star Trek Discovery and Kelvin Timeline, Masters of the Universe, Foundation - can't even get through 10 minutes of these pretenders. Dune is visually stunning and coherent. The story telling flows, the characters are compelling and you get invested in them. It isn't pretentious or forced and feels naturally immersive. Lots of great material to work with and the editing does justice and creates the flow that keeps you from turning away. Screw the writers that think they are clever because they think a divided fan base is a sign of success. This is one you will not only get through but will watch more than once. Go enjoy it.",5
100659,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"So to expound a little bit  on the new Dune movie. It is a very faithful reflection of the book, and that is why it's so good. Villeneuve has subtly rammed it with dense references to the source material. Couple bits left out (the dinner party for example) Bombadil style, but he can be forgiven for that. 2.5 hours is a long time and whilst there was a pleasing amount of exposition it literally flew by. My friend sitting next to me (who hadn't read the book) felt the same. I will say perhaps the emotional connection wasn't quite what I'd hoped for - the first half of the book is meant to be quite harrowing, but it is a great and unique movie, that relegates the Lynch version to its deserved place in the dustbin of history. ‘The same feeling as when I saw A New Hope or Fellowship of the Ring?' possibly not, but that could just be the fact that I am older and more jaded. In my opinion however it is the best sci-fi movie since Return of the Jedi in ‘83. But this is different - with Star Wars the source material was thinner and more childlike, here you are adapting what is effectively literature, the pinnacle of the genre and the themes are deeper, darker and more adult - and that's the reason non sci-fi fans should also see it. I don't particularly like RomComs but I love ‘When Harry Met Sally.' Bladerunner 2049 was a visual treat but lacked the resonance of the and source material of the original. Game of Thrones went slowly downhill when it veered from the books. The source material for Dune is arguably best in class and the movie does it justice. It's always good to experience the best in class even if you're unfamiliar with a genre. Villeneuve deserves a lot of credit for this movie.",5
100660,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"hands down one of the best movie It match the book do well and can't wait for part two of book one! Director Denis Villeneuve compiled a beautiful collection of scenes that are truly a sight to see. One thing you’ll notice is how the cinematography seamlessly compliments so many elements in the film.  Dune is so masterfully shot, that you could watch this movie on mute and still be entertained. Unlike the original film and the TV series,  the plot was easy to follow. Despite the dense, sci-elements in the s ...MORE",5
100661,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"This film is incredibly beautiful, from the sets, costume design, special effects, cinematography to the faces of the actors. Each scene is mesmerizing. It’s not a stand alone film- and ends abruptly. But that is really my only real complaint, and I’m hoping for more! The directing was a friend to the actors- even Jason Momoa seemed believable. The camera loves Timothee Chalomet! His face is as sculptural as the sand dunes and the amazing architecture. The amount of comedy was just right. Overall, a total blast and feast for the eyes. Remarkable job of creating alternative universes.",4
100662,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,I really enjoyed DUNE.  It is a long movie but gripping as the sci fi adventure unfolds.   For a remake it is a vast improvement on the original David Lynch 1984 version.  There is a lot of setup story to tell however it is portrayed in an epic way melding adventure and politics into a powerful narrative which is enhanced 'white knuckle' post production.   One minor comment is that the movie is devoid of comic relief so be prepared to tense up and hold on for a long wild ride. Looking forward to the next movie in the series.,4
100663,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Truly an amazing movie. Dennis Villeneuve never disappoints me. This is the part one, so understandably, everything they showed here may not be breathtaking or peak of action and climax but rather slowly creates the strong worldbuilding and spiritual lore of Dune. The score of Hans Zimmer and cinematography of Greig Fraser are at its bests. I believed with the upcoming sequel part(s), it will complete as great sci-fi saga.",4
100664,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"First off Dune is visually stunning, al of the locations in the movie look beautiful.  The movie uses it time to mainly show Timothée Chalamet and Rebeca Ferguson’s characters, but I also loved Oscar Isaac and Zendaya in movie. The film is just over 2hrs and 30 minutes long and provides enough to keep you waiting for part 2. Also It was nice to see David Dastmalchian in the movie since he was so amazing in the suicide squad! Overall my final rating for Dune (2021) is 4/5",4
100665,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,This is an epic movie that is best enjoyed at the theater! It is a visual and audio feast with soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and amazing special affects. I loved the original one and now I am a big fan of this new series. My only criticism is that the director decided to try and split these into a trilogy which may or may not come back to bite him. This movie ended upruptly and is not a stand alone movie due to this. Hence the 4 out if 5 stars. Looking forward to the next one in 2023!,4
100666,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"If I could I would have given a 4.5 rating. I haven't read the book yet, but after watching this I honestly have lost the urge to do so. Everything the movie portrays is perfect and hooks you up until the last. A gem of an adaptation of the Dune by Frank  Herbert. The cinematography, bgm, and score are truly remarkable. I can honestly call this a masterpiece of Denis Villeneuve, after arrival and prisoners. Please do go to the theatres to watch this, a little profit can ensure the second part. Thank you for this movie, worth watching.",4
100667,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"This film is a great film, really. It looks great, and Hans Zimmer must have been insane while making the soundtrack, because it isn't the kind of thing a sane person could have composed, it is literally out of this world. The cinematography is well done, and the focus on characters faces really conveys emotions. The atmosphere is well built, but there is one thing that I personally didn't like: the movie drags out way too long, and doesn't really have a satisfying conclusion. The length is probably just something that affected me, and shouldn't be a turnoff for anyone who wants to experience this movie, but I will say that you have to have a decent attention span to watch it. Good show. Too long. Jason Momoa is really cool.",4
100668,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I think that this is a fantastic film. Having not read any of the books, there were a couple of moments in it which didn't quite make sense to me, but other than that, I enjoyed it thoroughly and wouldn't hesitate to recommend  it to anyone else. All of the actors were great in their respective roles, and both the directing, as well as the special effects, were top notch. I'm now very much looking forward to seeing the second movie!",4
100669,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,Starwars fans watch out this is a similarly designed  but... with spice . Got it you'll tank me later. The actors where amazing. Sadly one of them have little screen time and was on all red carpets so I feel for her sitting on the premise for 2 half hour for so little . But she looks amazing. Director made this hight quality movie. The writers focus on a similar story from the movie I mention before. (Hope) fully reference intended. The second part will show more action from the main character and his abilities .which  are yet not clear on part one . Jedi...diah? Lol 😆  sorry I can't stop referring similarities. 😅  I'll recomend for before bed it's nice.  Enjoy,4
100670,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"As a fan of all of Frank Herberts Dune novels it is hard to be convinced by any adaption of these works.But Dennis Villeneuve delivered a very solid modern hard scifi movie.If is stunningly beautyful, very aesthetic like all Of Villeneuves works, but it is also a very good adaption of the story.Yes it was seriously tuned down, much simplified, streamlined for mass consumption... but in a way that still respects the tone and intention of the book.All actors are really fantastic, the movie has very slow paced, deep emotional moments of tense character acting, the action scenes are brutal, gritty, dark.I am hoping for part two to be a bit more mystical,psychedelic too because the dark religious critique of dune is also very important.This is not only a book about colonialism , i,perialism or enviromental issues... it is also about totalitarianism, religious fundamentalism, social and religious engineering, drugs, eugenics and much more.",4
100671,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"A little confusing, terrible ending, and ok cgi.  I think it's an opportunity to use a lot of cool CGI and have epic battles but none of that appears in the movie. It looks like they got cheap on the epic scenes which I think is one of the things that I really enjoy about good Sci-Fi movies.  There are also a  lot of holes and inconsistentcies.  For example there's some sort of hovering technology but they don't use it when it needs to be aused.   They have cannons and guns but the fights are with swords which makes no sense. And they have some pretty cool flying machines that look like dragonflies but it too just looks so wrong because if you're in the future presumably you're going to focus on efficiency not inefficiency so the circular motion is clearly more efficient. Overall it's a mediocre movie.  This is where I'm really happy to have hbo.",3
100672,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"A gorgeous, gorgeous film. I spent the first half going, ""He's done it! He's really done it!"" But sadly, the second half (after the battle) just dragged for me. Personally, I think this film could've taken more room to examine the politics (and show more of those parts of the world that get glossed over, like the Navigators and Mentats) and then ended when Jessica and Paul escape the battle. The second film could've picked up with them joining the Fremen. It probably would've wound up as a trilogy, but I could've lived with that. That said, it may be that I change my mind after seeing this again. Part of what kept me at a distance was knowing that it was 155-minute film without any way to pause it, and I'd had two cocktails so knew I'd need the loo... 😂",3
100673,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"So one thing Dune did convince me to do was to order the book. The story seems very interesting and the characters deep and unusual.  The movie was like a book tease. It only highlighted what I can only imagine is a wonderful story...will have to come back and let you know. The movie seemed to me a very dramatic attempt to tell a beautiful story but left us with so many questions. It seems like they tried to take a complicated multi novel story and cram it down our throats using too many slow motion sequences and overly gritty music....I do like moments of it though. Has Zimmer is amazing at capturing feeling. Ieft watching the movie intrigued and wanting more. However,  the fact that it's getting so many Oscar nods seems to me like a slap in the authors face.. who are these wonderful characters?  What is the order of the Reverand Mother? What's up with the white eyes? What is spice...obviously an important element? Why is the mother not the Queen?...hope to get answers from the book. Amazon can't deliver it fast enough. The movie was a stunning visually and definitely held my interest.  I can't wait to see what happens next...",3
100674,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"If you like scifi, you'll love Dune. If you're like me, and anything after the original Star Trek is pretty boring, then there is still much to admire. This is principally the camera work and Hans Zimmer's score. Great atmosphere. Other than that, there is a rather formulaic eco-wokey plot and the acting is OK, even if the characters are rather cardboard. There are some exciting bits and thankfully it's not all stupid Star War'sy shootout stuff. The ending had zero climactic tension, but, of course, they want to drag you to the next episode.",3
100675,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"When reading the books, the author made you care about House Atreides. The first Dune movie somewhat succeeded in making you care about the family, however I feel this 2021 version fails completely in that regard.  The chosen story telling about a wealthy ruling class family did NOT succeed in establishing an emotional connection as to why we should care about their demise. Another flat area was the Harkonnens being described as brutal, but not really shown to be. Only one decent scene involving the Bene Gesserit, and the typical over the top angry man that dies in hand to hand fight. The visual effects and cinematography are phenomenal and that is its saving grace. I just wish the story telling had been better.",3
100676,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"They had a great cast, big budget, and DENSE book(s) to blow this movie into space. Unfortunately, the character development was as thin as the water that planet craves. It felt like an HBO series with the same cast and budget could have made this the next Game of Thrones. Instead, it gave just enough detail to understand the plot but tried to make up for it with the gorgeous cinematography and CGI. I feel if they could somehow combine the character depth of the 84’ version with today’s photography- it’d be great. Instead, it’s another expected swing and miss at this THICC series. Maybe it’ll hit the mark in another 30 years…",3
100677,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,The videographer and director did a stunning job! This movie left a lot of lose ends for me. And also Zendaya was in it for like two seconds. So they better make a another one. Also Will there be more ? Because I felt like finally when we were getting somewhere and the gloves were coming off it all ended. Also would love to see how the Bene gesreit’s prophecy originated! That would bring more respect and understanding for Paul’s character development! Anyway BEAUTIFUL CAST AND STORY!,3
100678,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I’m sorry but I’m not seeing what several others were seeing in this version of Dune. Yes, parts like the book, but mostly BORING. It’s difficult to connect to any of the characters on an emotional level they all appear to be one dimensional and not true depth of emotional content or character there to make one identify with the characters. Paul’s character was detached and dreaming throughout the movie, when he finally had opportunities to truly open up…whoa, it never happened even after meeting Chani who he’d been dreaming about the entire movie. His mother, Jessica, didn’t show the strength of the previous version of the movie Dune from the 80’s, she seemed more in peril or scared the entire movie and the list can go on. I and many friends disappointed at this version and nothing to inspire one to want to see more. Very sad being a real dune fan for over 30yrs this was disappointing at best, if there is another one…hopefully more happening to link us with the characters and events that are defining their universes and views. Again, I’m sorry this was a 3/5 at best…boring.",3
100679,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"It seems as though they just want us to wait and watch Part 2, instead of this. There are so many visions of the future that it becomes intrusive- it spoils itself, and makes it seem as though this entire part 1 could've been a text block at the beginning. The soundtrack, sets, costumes are all spectacular, but the story itself takes an hour and a half of hushed, whispered exposition just to set up. No context is offered (you can't make me read a book to prepare for a movie) for why everyone fights with swords 8,000 years in the future, why the Atreides have been put in control of Arrakis in the first place, what's so important about that fight to the death at the end, who the Emperor they're doing all this for even is... I'll very likely see Part 2, if only because Part 1 has made it clear that that's when it'll finally get interesting.",3
100680,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I loved the story when I read it in Analog back in the day - and enjoyed a reread five years ago.  This new movie is the best of all and is true in details and dialog with the novel - plus wonderful cgi.  However, this seems like a cliffs notes version to me ... so much of the character interaction and story texture found in the novel is missing - necessary in even a two part movie, I guess.  We jump from scene to scene - and the 2+ hours moves very quickly - but the pace never allowed me to connect with the characters or story.  If you never read the novel, you experience may be different.  Definitely worth seeing - hoping part two works better for me though.",3
100681,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Plodding, predictable, didn’t nearly live up to all the hype of the trailers. Cinematic, epic storytelling at times and yet gets bogged down by the slow plot so frequently that you can’t wait for it to all be over and be put out of your misery. Unless you’ve read the books, there’s not nearly enough backstory for characters, so you don’t really know who’s who. CGI effects are incredible at times and cheesy at others. One scene can be entirely believable from an effects perspective and then the next scene can be completely laughable. It’s almost like they ran out of money to do the visual effects properly throughout the entire movie. Josh Brolin and Jason Mamoa are much better actors than the characters they portray on-screen and do not live up to their artistic potential. Ditto for the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), who looks partly like Jabba the Hut. Speaking of which, Dune seems to borrow heavily from Star Wars and looks like Tatooine. Thematically, it’s part religious allegory, with Paul as Jesus (or the Messiah), and also seems to borrow heavily from the Muslim faith. There is so much foreshadowing and so many “Chekhov’s guns” (the ring, the knife, the bull’s head trophy, etc) in this movie that you know you’re going to see them again and again throughout the movie. Dune obviously sets up a sequel, and I’m sure it will bring in lots of money for Warner Brothers in spite of its many shortcomings. I feel like Dune had so much potential, but in the end it was a total letdown. Two and a half hours of my life I’ll never get back.",2
100682,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"The title ""Dune"" best describes the nothingness of the story in this movie. Actors look like models in front of the camera pretending they are doing and saying something interesting, when in my opinion, there is no story to care about. So far, this movie could be the best screensaver you could have in your pc for visual entertainment. My total admiration to all talented professionals, animators, designers, engineers who worked behind the cameras to craft this sublime piece of art.",2
100683,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,The visuals were great I must admit. Other than that it always kept me waiting for something to happen. This movie was so boring. They could have squeezed this kind of boredom in an hour and a half movie but didn't .Four of us went and four of us agreed that it stunk. Does anybody care about reality anymore? There is a scene where they crash into a planet at high speed. And walk out of the ship without a scratch. Just like a comic book movie. Visuals only go so far . Want to be bored ? Go see this movie .My score...D  because I'm feeling kind tonight,2
100684,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"In my perspective, it's a long boring beautiful looking Steampunk-Utopia Sci-fi. The script is not enough strong in the meanings and intentions. It's just more of a vision of this sand dunes sci-fi civilization in the far future. The costume and actors for each character are well crafted. The machines and transportation are super cool-looking man-made creations blends together with the concepts of ""DUNE"". Plus the action scene is sometimes a bit more awkward and weird simply not interesting especially when Tilgar gets killed by Paul Atreides, its toooooo awkward. But I just didn't feel enough the true meanings, intentions, and the point of making this cool-looking world. I think the director needs to have more time to create a good script-writing, not just the physical looks and impressions. I want to get to know more about each character.",2
100685,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"""You Bene Gesserit made me a freak!"" says Paul Atreides.  Yes, Paul, that's why you are Muad Dib.  Many more non-Dune issues:  Jason Momoa as  surfer dude Duncan Idaho, Thurfir's paper parasol, PTA mom Lady Jessica, no mystical space time Navigators, purposeful engine choking sounds during escape  (we're still using gas engines? Gah), Timothee Chalamet might have a bad case of mono and needs to eat.  OK, I'll stop. As a big fan of the books and 1984 version, this did not work for me. I am glad that  many more found it fantastic and I hope they go on to read the books.",2
100686,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I had high expectations for this movie. Not entirely disappointed but did not leave the theatre loving it. To start on a good note though, the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking.  The world building was very interesting, though I wish the film focused more on explaining it rather than trying to be mysterious. I appreciate both methods but there could have been a better balance. Pacing was INCREDIBLY slow. I hate to say it but it was a long 2 hours with minimal enjoyment. As a die hard Star Wars fan, I watched this movie because Star Wars took some inspiration from the books and I saw a lot of cool resemblance. Might need to watch the movie to retain it but until then I have to give it 2 stars.",2
100687,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I was super excited for this film especially after seeing so many previews for it (I work at a movie theatre!) But surprisingly I was disappointed. The visuals of the film and the music were pretty great, but at some parts of the movie I just got lost and I had no clue about what was going on. I don’t want people coming at me telling me I should have read the book cuz I actually didn’t know there was a book till Dune came out. I was watching it with my best friend and she fell asleep lmao. And I was also pretty bummed that they didn’t feature Zendaya very much since I was excited to see her in the movie. I felt as if she barely got any screen time - only in some scenes, in the beginning and also at the end. Overall, I’ll probably prefer the new Bond movie or a different film over this movie I watched🤷🏻‍♀️
",2
100688,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,Why did you guys make it so long and then end the movie.I understand that boy had powers but it did play out with the girl in the dreams and short notice also horrible fight scenes and who thought about a fat floating men in black liquid yo.. then the random scene of Bastia getting mad was this a comedy or Action. Also why did his dreams never happen kinda boring repeat over the move his kingdom across a galaxy part like yo if you gone to waste our 2hr and 30mins of life at least let us see more deaths or fights. It was cool how the teeth had poison and killed the guys. Then you had famous actors with minor roles could this have possibly been a cheap film? It keep me entertained but I would rather a bit more action less dramatic,2
100689,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Great visuals and interpretations of the novel's technology. However, movies need more than impressive visuals to be good. Acting throughout the movie is a roller coaster with many ups and downs and is generally average / sub-par. Some of the characters may have been mis-cast: they may be good actors but aren't suited for the roles they depicted in this particular film. There's too much exposition dump that could have been relegated to character's conversation that could have helped with world building and a lot of important subjects unexplained that can leave those unfamiliar with the novel guessing. Some aspects of the film are even down-right silly and don't fit with a serious story such as Dune. If you want to spend a couple of hours admiring stunning visuals, you ought to see it. If you're looking for an excellent movie this isn't the one.",2
100690,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I love the cast so much they're amazing actors but the movie is just really really boring. A 21/2 hr movie where the action part starts to happen somewhere close to the end. Let alone this is only this is the first part of the story. I understand that the crew wanted to be detailed but it's too much. To be fair I didn't watch Dune 1984 however on a personal matter certain scenes I felt uncomfortable while watching it, could be because I didn't understand the original story from the book itself but the feeling was there. Don't get me wrong the characteristics of the character are interesting and the sand is the spice(if I'm not mistaken, I kinda slept from time to time in the movie). Hopefully, the sequel won't be as long as this one and makes it more understandable or more sense for those who arent a dune fan like myself.",2
100691,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Amazing art direction and best CGI I've ever seen.  The sci-fi tech conceptions are breathtaking.  At two & 1/2 hours, it seems twice as long.  Half the movie is long, long, loooooong, lingering, caressing shots of Timothy Chalomet, who may be the most beautiful boy in Hollywood history, but isn't that interesting or sympathetic.  Where Kyle MacLachlan may have been too bland in 1984, Chalomet alternates blandness with a teenage moody-broody-pouty-whiny angst.  I won't be seeing Part Two.",1
100692,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"If negative stars existed, I would use them. The character development was flatter than moldy soda. Literally the scenes were less organized than chilli that came out my rear end. I never ever thought a straight man would dream about Zendaya ever that much within two and a half hours of screen time, yet here we are. Dune is the absolute pinnacle of terrible movies created in the 21st century. I rather watch the Avatar movie on repeat for the rest of my life than see a second of this absolute cancer. And lastly, Paul and his mom were totally doing some spicy things between the scenes, no doubt about it.",1
100693,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Good? Please…I saw the Lynch version (which considering the special effects available wasn’t too bad) and understood it all from beginning to end…this wasn’t anything like it. My husband, who has never watched Dune so doesn’t know the storyline, fell asleep over and over. I had to continuously stop the movie (on HBO MAX) to explain background info. Afterwards I played the Lynch version and Oh My Gosh I couldn’t tear him away because he understood the background story (despite the dated special effects). Now we have to wait for Dune 2 and possibly 3? Not us - save your money and buy the Director’s Cut of Lynch’s movie. You won’t regret it like you will watching this version",1
100694,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"I liked the modern film making effects however, it fell very short for me.   There obviously has to be a sequel as it did not even go as far in the original movie’s story.  I actually loved the original movie and probably watched it 10+ times… I won’t be even watching this version a 2nd time!   What’s with all the armies fighting with swords?  This is the year 10,000+ so you’d think technology would have been more advanced there.  Also, the main weapon of the first move was voice/sound activated… that weapon was not even in this movie which was the main think I was looking forward to seeing what they did with it in the modern movie making.   For me it was all about Paul having special powers and this was very missing as he just seemed like a normal person.   As you can see I’m pretty disappointed as I was so much looking forward to this being a great movie.",1
100695,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,I waited so long for this film because the trailer seduced me not knowing anything about the d'une universe ! The cast was AMAZING so many great actors I said this can only be great but you know they proved me wrong !! right when things was starting to happen and the movie was finally getting some action it stop ? like it literally ENDS right there just like that.. wow wow I'm so dissapointed two hours for a whole lot of nothingness and prolonged trailer is what that was   ,1
100696,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"For me I just wanted to end my suffering immediately. Yes this is meant to be a serious film. I thought one laugh would have made all the difference though. It is a very long film to go and see which is not a bad thing. I was very bored during this film due to the fact that out of the whole run time there was never a change of scenery or tone for me. Without going into spoilers there was a part of the film I found very frustrating. Basically the main character Paul gets these dreams/visions of the character played by Zendaya. This would be interesting if it was way less frequent. It felt forced a lot of the time. It was need for I say 2 times but not as much as they showed. Overall I am not one to go and tell you not to see the movie. I'd say by far my favorite parts were the character Duncan, the music which was great but just a bit loud and hearing josh brolin say things. I found my own comedy when Josh Brolin spoke as I just imagined he was thanos sometimes. Overall I went to see this with a friend who enjoyed it and I think that is great. Even though this is not a film for me in anyway shape or form, I think if you want to see it go and see it. If you read this review and have adhd like me then I wouldn't recommend seeing this at the Cinema. I think if I were at home and watched it in parts it may have been better.",1
100697,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"Lacks. The acting in this version is forced, as is the story as a whole. Zendaya's character is lost in a gaggle of background freemen, Paul seems lost in a vat of spice and Duncan just doesn't go away. The Harkonnen in the new adaptation seem ""nice"" and about as sinister as galactic bunnies. Casting in the original film adaptation of DUNE was way better than the current casting: especially among House Atredies and the Freemen. It was obvious the producers and studio executives pressured and rushed the production crew to finish. Now the visuals for DUNE '21 are outstanding but considering DUNE '84 didn't have over 25 years of Hollywood cg tech advances to work with, DUNE'84 held its own visually.",1
100698,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"cinematography is like blade runner 2049 - great expanse of deserts and high ceilings large encloed spaces. lots monotone color. but the characters are like boilerplate stocks:  fat villains, hero royal soldiers, protective mother, and a teen with vision doing things he does not want to do.  this is part 1 - so the ending just hang. not interested in part 2. fighting using swards in human waves in a scifi film... custom-wise - a lot of robes flapping in the desert wind. added together, too pretentiousness. teh hero's knife fight w/jamis was lackluster.",1
100699,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"This movie was miserable. It dragged on and on and on with the same ""run for your life"" scenes over and over again. After watching this for 2.5 painful hours, I am still unclear about the full plot. Everything in this movie could have been accomplished in 90 minutes with more detail to give the viewer an exponentially better experience. I am truly baffled at the number of people who enjoyed this movie and think that they are just massive movie buffs that love a more artsy, intricate movie. They dance around the plot leaving the viewer to fill in the gaps as the movie drags on. This left me completely uninterested after the first 30 minutes. There is no hook. You are just in this constant state of confusion and bore. Overall, if you are a normal movie watcher like me with an untrained eye, you will likely be massively disappointed by this movie. You could not pay me to sit through it again.",1
100700,Dune,2021,Sci-fi/Adventure,"As soon as me and my father sat down to watch the 2h 30m movie Dune in my head when I seen the movie title pop up on screen I knew that we have been scammed by WB into watching a bedtime  story. It was so bad my father fell asleep 6 to 7 times. After the movie ended we were free. WB at the start basically said ""you paid to watch, might as well stay"" I recommend doing the maximum research you can and DO NOT TRUST THE 5 STAR REVIEWS THEY MOST LIKELY WERE INVOLVED IN THE SCAM.",1
100701,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,Black Widow has become one of my personal favorite movies. I don't know why it is getting much fewer ratings. Maybe they were expecting more of Black Widow origin.,5

It Feels So Damn Good to Finally See an MCU Movie In Theaters coz It's Been 2 Years and The Last MCU Movie I Saw In Theaters was Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Far From Home and It is Time for Marvel Movies to Finally Be Back in The Big Screen But The Best Part About This Movie was THE POST-CREDITS Scene, The Post-Credits Scene Didn't Set Up a Movie But A Disney+ Show that We'll Be Seeing Later This Year, But I Won't Say WHAT Disney+ Show it Sets Up But The Post Credits Scene is Gonna Blow EVERYONE AWAY, Definitely Check It Out In Theaters! I Gotta Say, Marvel has Balls to Do Crazy Things to Make Us Marvel Fans Go Nuts! I Give Black Widow 9/10, 5 Stars!

100703,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"There's is a considerable amount of love for the characters like iron man, captain America, and thor in the marvel cinematic universe. But black widow appears to be quite an underrated character. The instant thought of not-that-of-a-powerful-hero is what pours into most minds. From my opinion, black widow has always been an unique character to us, with many attractive abilities and equipments to fight. She has special skills, very clever ideas, and one of the main characters to not give up. Scarlett Johansson is an amazing actress but she shouldn't be the only reason for us to love black widow. The character herself is very loveable and her story is so so interesting. I love Natasha Romanoff and this movie personally, is gonna mean so much to me❤️ i genuinely hope it gets the rightful recognition and love as it deserves",5
100704,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"It's my best superhero movie based on a female superhero of all time . Also it becomes my favourite MCU stand alone superhero movie Because it has similar tone of captain america the winter soldier . It's fight scenes are really awesome . It is really good , really epic , really superb . I really appreciate and enjoyed this movie . Thanks Marvel Studios , I am a big fan of your movies , and what to say about Scarlett Johansson ( not because of her beauty ) her acting was really great . And not mention about Florence Pugh's character Yelena Belova , she is winning the hearts of marvel fans and she is shining now . Her acting was so good that it show her love and affection for her sister Natasha . Love you Florence Pugh . Love you Scarlett Johansson very much ♥️ and lots of love from me to Marvel Studios . All the actors played their role greatly . I appreciate them very much .",5
100705,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"This film is definitely in my top 3 marvel movies of all time. For Black Widow having not any special powers, the action in this movie was incredible, fast-paced, and exhilarating and much more complex and entertaining than I could have imagined. To me, this movie was an absolute 10/10 but with a woman holding the lead role I think critics and society automatically bring it down to a lower level than it should be. This movie literally contains some of the best action and combat scenes I've ever seen regardless of it being a female-led movie and especially being that Black Widow has no special powers. Nonetheless, the dark story of the movie in my opinion was carried along perfectly alongside its constant action. After watching this movie I couldn't be sadder that Black Widow will no longer properly appear in MCU. It really saddens me that this movie was released during a time that it was basically set up for failure in the box office, but it truly was incredible and captivating and I hope Marvel will follow continue to make movies just like this.",5
100706,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"HUGE Marvel fan & love the MCU! Black Widow is an action packed movie that delivers what fans of Scarlett have been waiting for. It’s not exactly like most phase 2-4 movies/shows, but it’s AMAZING & worth seeing on the big screen or $30 for Disney+ if this was a VHS tape, our copy would already be worn out. Pugh will make an incredible new BW & can’t wait to see more from her in Hawkeye👍🏼❤️. Remember Trolls will be Trolls & this is Fiege aka The Godfather of movie making, it’s another hit.",5
100707,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Personally, I loved it. I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea but I would really recommend you give it a try. Seeing Natasha Romanoff in the female gaze is so much better than the male gaze. The opening credit scene is jaw-dropping. Florence Pugh was fantastic beyond belief and perfectly fitted the role of Yelena Belova. Rachel Weiz and David Harbour and O.J were also fantastic! Plenty of action but you also get to see the vulnerable side of each character which I really enjoyed and the family dynamic throughout the whole film was amazing and David harbour was hilarious. This film passed all my expectations. ",5
100708,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I watched it opening night and it was amazing, a 10/10(I cried like 5 times,  it was very emotional for me just because I love her so much❤🕷) . This movie should have been made a decade ago, in fact she should have had the first female superhero movie just because she is an ORGINAL 6 and was the first big female superhero introdued but this movie was worth the wait, it was a perfect blend of emotions and action. My only issues would have to be Taskmaster and how they introdued Yelena. It felt like they were more focused on Yelena or more so Nat's family then Nat herself and I get why but at times I felt Nat was the side kick or partner instead of Yelena. I tried to write this without any spoilers but I LOVE this movie, like Black Widow is my all time favorite Marvel hero and I love to see the apprcation that is being given to her. Also,  STAY FOR THE AFTER CREDIT SCENE, it was worth it. All im gonna say is that it made me sad and upset.",5
100709,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"What an incredibly amazing action movie! To my astonishment, this film exceeds what I expected before starting to watch it, especially the energetic force of feminine martial arts and mind-blowing stunts.  Even, this film definitely surpasses all the Bond movies, particularly because the aerial battle left me totally speechless!  The supervillain Taskmaster is not as strong as the Black Widow family, because she is being brainwashed by her boss General Dreykov.  All the Black Widow agents, which they confront to their darker past, and the Red Guardian go to destroy the Red Room which brainwashes all female agents until the red vial frees their mind.  Well done to those who did their superb job for this extraordinary action film.",5
100710,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I absolutely love this movie! I just saw it the second time today, and the acting was on point. Scarlett Jo's best performance in the mcu. Great plot, supporting cast, and music (especially since grunge is back.) The end scene made me cry a little. There were 2 spoilers in this movie the first was at the end scene where the gave a spoiler for a hawkeye show and possibly Julia Louis-Dreyfus (better known as Elaine from Seinfeld or in the MCU, Valentina) And when the TaskMaster is fighting the ""Red Guardian"" She does the Wolverine's claw sheath thing which means there will probably be an X-Men Crossover. 11/10!",5
100711,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"This movie was very well done, but not your typical, lighthearted marvel movie. The theme of this movie highly surrounds the real reality of human trafficking, including an almost traumatizing minute long montage in the beginning of young children being kidnapped and put through trafficking (me and my mom almost left the theatre because of how intense it was). There is quite a bit of violence—more than typical in marvel—and a bit of swearing (mostly in Russian). However, the acting was incredible in this film and the chemistry between characters was off the charts. Marvel did a wonderful job of bringing to light Natasha’s past while also bringing closure to it. I would highly recommend for MATURE AUDIENCES. Please do not show this film to children!!!",4
100712,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Like any other first solo venture, BW must go into great detail about Natasha's past. If you're a comic buff, this usually puts most enthusiasts to bed. Not due to poor quality or a lack of continuity, its simply because we know the story and we want to get to the significant portion of the exposition. Nevertheless, the introduction of Taskmaster and Russia's version of Capt. America was somewhat pleasing to the eye, but lacking a bit of volume (especially Taskmaster). However, the ending makes up for the lack of familiarity or relative exposure that we so often take for granted. If only there could have been more instances of Taskmaster CLEARLY mimicking her opponent....WOW! All in all, I give this standalone MCU venture a 7 out of 10. Not bad for a first solo film Mrs. Johansson.",4
100713,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"It's a fun and nice movie overall with a good fleshing out of Black Widow's general character and story. The qualms I really have with this movie is its release, as it should have been released right after Civil War so its impact was stronger and allowed for a deeper connection between the audience and Black Widow. This movie also has an issue with the advertised antagonist of Task Master being quite underwhelming. Although I know this movie isn't anywhere near being Task Master's story or even require the character to be that fleshed out, it would have been nicer for the advertised villain to be more developed. Other than that it's a solid movie with a solid story and helps add more depth to characters new and old in the MCU.",4
100714,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,An entertaining blockbuster with amazing performances all round. As an MCU film it's not one of the greatest but sure adds an extra dimension to Widow's fate in Infinity war which is never a negative. The villains fell short but the heroes and the amazing action sequences made up for it. A movie worth going back to the theaters for and the excellent performances made me left me wanting more from the new cast members.,4
100715,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Black Widow is a spy thriller, action packed film. The first 30 minute on this was like a non-stop action because it's action packed. The whole film tells a story about Natasha 5 years ago about Natasha going back to her haunted past which was Taskmaster. Now Taskmaster was a big disappointment because she is just Dreykov project and the main villain turns out to be Dreykov. It's kinda like Captain America the winter soldier where the main villain is Alexadra Pierce and the winter soldier is his project so the villain in this film isn't that great. Some moments in this film is very thrilling especially the fight with Taskmaster on the bridge. The film is also like PG-13 Mature with some dark tone, this is probably one of the most darkest film in the MCU. The action in this film makes the whole film like full with action such as the car chase, the bridge fight, the prison break, sister reunion and the red room fight. Well it's not for kids under 13 to watch because the action does have violence in it. Another thing that I really love is the character, the character is the reason why the MCU franchise is a successful franchise. The character backstory looks satisfying, emotional, with some thrilling moments and the family reunion was also emotional. The whole film wasn't too little, it's not too small the whole film is just a journey for Natasha going back to her past. The villain doesn't have any super evil plan. Now the film the story does feels kind of late but I don't really care much. ",4
100716,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Alright, somethings could be better done but, from the standpoint in Audio design, scriptwriting, filming and CGI this was a really good movie. Its more serious than the other marvel movies and has a bit James Bond. The thing that I liked about this movie is that all the female characters weren't woke feminists trying to take down the male gender, wonderwoman 2 does that. Their characters wasn't just I'm a female. It is something else than your average superhero movie. The things that could be better were;  Character writing, a longer shots in Norway, the widdows acting but overall Highly recommended.",4
100717,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Excellent Film. Not the best Marvel installment, but I would consider it somewhat of a top-tier addition. It has it's flaws, and the timing of the release is  obviously way too late, but what can you do during a global pandemic, right? I liked this more than most people, mainly because it lived up to the hype and exceeded my expectations. Amazing Cast and Action--I loved it. I would say it's worth the $30 on Disney+ if you want to go that route, but the Theater is the place to go for this one, folks! ",4
100718,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,This was SOOOOO much better than I thought it would be. I expected marvel not to put much effort into this but it's surprisingly well done and easily one of the better marvel films. Love me a good standalone action film and this feels like one in the MCU. I just wish they had used more Russian actors for the main cast however all the actors did very well regardless!,4
100719,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I can't understand why this film is only a 6.8/10 if I'm being honest. I thought it was a solid 7.5 because of how well put together the fight scenes were and how brilliant the Russian accents were. The setup for the Hawkeye series is also a big plus, as Florence Pugh was arguably the stand out of the film. The red guardian brought back another thing what set marvel films apart from the earlier DC films which is the humor",4
100720,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,Well black widow is a great movie  I say that because  it brought a new  side of a character  that we have new for 10 years  so I loved that I also loved  Florence Pugh  as yelena she outshines black widow in many ways  .Black widow  has no sense of humor  yelena does the poses thats a good one . I love the end where its all blowing up and there flying out of the air that is very cool also I love the story line these girls are being  controlled  and they have to stop it  the parents are very funny   the bad is this came out way to late 5 years late and if at came out at that time maybe yelena could have been in infinity  war or engame but it came out when the character is dead  so I say watch this movie  also if you like combat then you are going to love this.,4
100721,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"i LOVE mcu movies!!! i know they have an almost unfair chokehold on the superhero genre but for good reason,, their pictures are almost always impeccable. like you can't make a superhero movie and not be held up to the mcu standard. that being said, this is one of MCU's average movies and i'm not sure i'm happy with that being the case considering this is about BLACK WIDOW the matriarch the queen the goddess and this is her last movie. not that this movie isn't great, but she deserves better !!!! the movie does have everything honestly--sophisticated and imaginative action scenes (fighting in the air?? FAMMM), a heartwarming focus on the meaning of family, and the MCU trademark of on-point humor... but so much more could be done. this could have easily been a damnation of like the villainization of science but more importantly, the patriarchy, if they explored the analogy of the Red Room and the Widows even more. sm to be unpacked there. also a few unnecessary things like the token brown guy and annoying hollywood tropes like colored folks only being in extra roles (all the main cs are white? come on guys, you can't just have black panther to make up for everything and say bye to diversity) and the big airplane for the finale, but it's eh excusable. also florence pugh's signature ""no"" *sad face*  is a little funny when it should be actually well sad.",3
100722,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I feel like this movie started out really good giving hints of a espionage thriller that would chill us to our core. But it quickly deflated into your typical superhero movie that brought nothing new to the table. The amount of explosions and bombs they survived just felt ridiculous by the end because they aren’t the hulk or Thor and I thought this film would show us why people like the black widow and Hawkeye can be useful and dangerous but no, they are invincible like everyone else (except in endgame).this could have been a epic final blast for Natasha but it just felt flat and as if I had seen this movie a hundred times before and wasn’t the finale we needed. It was largely unsatisfactory but Florence Pughs performance was a real highlight and saved this movie in many ways and I am excited to see her in more marvel content.",3
100723,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Honestly, it's not a bad movie. The sister character is funny, and the action scenes are well choreographed. My main gripe is that it has no rewatch ability. Some movies leave little bread crumbs as to who the final boss is, or where the evil layer is located, but this movie just dances around the unknowns until they eventually plop or down right in front of you. I would have rated this a 4 star, as it honestly wasn't bad(and especially not as bad as a lot of the 1 star reviews are saying it is), but they changed my favorite marvel villain (the task master) into a female who's abilities are only due to a chip in her head. Honestly, it was the biggest, and most predictable let down in any marvel movie so far.",3
100724,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Unfortunately this movie falls under the same disappointing category as Ant Man and the Wasp, with a great premise and a great set up of idea only to be completely squandered by unnecessary jokes, a lack of cohesive story telling and a certain “agenda” to it. It’s not anywhere near as bad as Captain Marvel which is the worst MCU movie made and one of my least favorite movies I’ve ever seen in general. The disappointment in this movie stems from the fact they COULD HAVE made an amazing movie and blew it. The “villain” of this movie is worse than any previous villain and that is saying a lot. They ruined a great comic book villain by taking everything that made them awesome in the comics. Definitely was not worth a 15-16 month delay of release and should have just been released on Disney+. I so badly wanted this movie to be good and was so sad to see it ruined. I don’t think I’ll be seeing another MCU movie until Dr. Strange 2 but I’ll be skipping Eternals and Shang Chi because they already don’t appeal to me at all, and will save the money. I remember thinking at one time that marvel would never make a bad film, but unfortunately that just isn’t the case. With 3 out of the last 5 releases being terrible disappointments since Infinity War (Endgame and Spider-Man 2 being the two GOOD movies), I am not optimistic they’ll course correct and it will only be one disappointing movie after another at this point. Particularly because they will continue to alienate their audience with very obvious “agendas” with what they’re trying to send as a message.",3
100725,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Could be better definitely could be worse. A but miss in the opportunity of learning about how Natasha became an badass and the lore that surrounds her. However we got to see her do what she does best. Kick butt, look sexy and keep it going. Other issue I have this movie felt overly ""feminist"" and I don't mind a female lead role at all. Battle angel Alita is a prime example of an amazing female lead.  Anyhow fun movie for the most part. Natasha/Scarlett will be missed but let's see how her sister fill that role in the future events of the marvel cinematics.",3
100726,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Somewhat Short and simple. Most of the reviews here will state that the character Yelena is the highlight of the film and essentially carry’s it unlike any of the other characters, and this is very true. I find it to be somewhat disappointing however that, this being Black Widows movie, it doesn’t feel like she’s being given the spotlight that she should be for her send-off movie. Every other character besides Yelena and perhaps David Harbours character is subpar in their development, ESPECIALLY Taskmaster. Spoiler alert but if you know you know. Taskmaster was essentially a couch potato in the film that felt like a rehash of Ghost from Ant-man, just showing up here and there. She-yes, she- feels comparable to the Mandarin in terms of how badly they screwed up the respective characters, perhaps even worse. I don’t usually have issues with gender swapping if it serves a purpose in the plot but there was literally no reason for the gender swap here, it served ZERO purpose. That’s not even why people are upset though. Throughout the movie Taskmaster remains idle whispering quiet lines, and that’s it. Other than that, the basic Marvel formula applies the same. A whole lot of action supplemented with light hearted comedy and some feel good/ emotional moments. This movie does it mediocre compared to other Marvel movies but it’s there. I am a huge Marvel fan, but Black Widow is practically a decade late and just didn’t deliver for me.",3
100727,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"An alright movie for the MCU, probably not going for a re-watch on it. There were many times that Natasha should have been severally injured as a human without super human abilities, and just kinda ""walked it off"". The plot I wasn't too crazy about, and the action wasn't too shabby. Any fight scene, special effects, were done great as always. If you are looking for something to watch while munching on a big bowl of president's choice popcorn, you have a movie right here for you.",3
100728,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Really good Action movie- It had Good Visual Special Effects, good story line, Love Scarlett J. the caring, empathy, the humor. Some of the SUPER LOUD ANNOYING SOUND EFFECTS and SUPER LOUD BLARING MUSIC was Awful though!!! it was so Loud at many Surprise Events or Struggles, it made you Lose the Experience of what was going on in the movie scene or Miss what the characters were Saying to Each Other because of the SCREECHING NOISE. My husband & I have left the theater several  times Early over the past few years during other movies that were SO ANNOYINGLY Loud it Totally Ruined the whole Movie Experience. We discussed leaving the theater early during this movie but gritted our teeth and stayed.. Why are they doing this over the top Sound Effects????? Sadly I felt forced to give this movie a lower Review because the NOISE was so Annoying.  Otherwise Awesome Movie!! :(",3
100729,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"There is a lot to like about this film. The action is pretty good, the supporting characters are great, and Scarlett Johansson is always cool. I really wanted to like this film but found it very ""meh"" at the end. The very bad script overshadowed what this movie could have become. And no, I'm not talking about story when I say script, I mean how things connected through the film. The connection with the ""family"" never felt real, the villain never felt threatening, her sister's feelings about the situation never felt fully explained. The movie assumes you know a lot when in reality they should have told more. The way the story plays out never really hits the mark which is why I think this movie will be forever on a shelf after you've watched it once.",3
100730,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I don’t know I’m not too thrilled with this one, in my opinion one of Marvel’s worse accomplishments. The plot of the film itself is a classic Marvel, and that's totally ok, you can't expect anything more or deeper, and therefore neither the script nor the acting. The character and life story of Natasha and her sister are well presented, everything is clear. The first hour, hour and a half of the film is a bit tiring until you see what exactly its about, and then the film goes from complicated to very easy to follow. The film is not for relaxation, but it is a kind of science fiction, so as a fan of the same, as well as Marvel's heroes, I watched the film. All in all, nothing is better or worse than other Marvel movies.",3
100731,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"From mind numbing, non-bone breaking,  and bloodless action to conceited and short sighted social commentary, IT'S ANOTHER MARVEL MOVIE. BY DISNEY! And it's not good. The titular character is more of a side character in her own movie. The ham fisted ""girls get it done"" and evil masculine overlord of a mindless female army reflect a continued shallow approach to female empowerment: female empowerment = falling off things (including literally exploding off of things)  without taking any damage. Much like Captain Marvel, the action scenes have no tension because our female characters appear invincible as they lunge from action scene to action scene through events that would kill our maim an average human 10 times over. The cartoon villain plot undermines the gravity of the family themes as well as the social commentary, and overall this is a movie that shouldn't have been made, but was to round out ScarJos contractual obligation to Disney's Marvel. MARVEL FAN BOYS WILL LOVE IT! Children will probably be mostly bored by it.",2
100732,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Honestly this is the most tired, predictable marvel movie since Thor 2. Everything just feels so forced and paint by numbers. Now this can be said for most marvel movies, but at least it felt like most of those were made with a purpose in mind and a story to tell, Black Widow feels like they just made it out of obligation. Genuinely a shame too, as everyone feels like they're trying their hardest to make this feel compelling, but the plot is somehow needlessly overcomplicated and totally boring all at once. Sure the action scenes are well done, the effects are stunning as ever and everything looks like it should, but it feels like we've reached the point where this just feels forced, and this is coming from someone who loves this franchise deeply and passionately. For a character with as much intrigue and mystique surrounding her as Black Widow you'd have thought they'd  be able to keep their audience engaged and actually care about what's going on, instead we get a slew of new dull characters throwing out the the same tired quips as always but with half the charm and double the preachyness. Do better marvel, we all want you to.",2
100733,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"A long a waited film for a lot of people. Black Widow has been hyped up to be this different more “grounded” side of the MCU and show a story of everyone’s favorite Avenger. But was it all worth it ? No plain and simple no . While the film does show a lot of good ideas it’s a flawed,awkward and unoriginal action movie that barely makes it to being one of the most forgettable MCU movies . Johansson is back as her title character and she does do a good job again. With her are Yelena Belova played by Florence Pugh which is a good addition. They both have very good and a believable sister relationship and the jokes that she makes are the actual good jokes of the movie . David Harbour and Rachel Weisz play Red Guardian and Melina Vostokoff, both work good together but feel tacked on than anything else . Actually the whole movie feels tacked on . The action scenes were a lackluster. Not to impressive but there were some scenes where the characters MOST of them are human defy the laws of gravity . The whole message and just overall feel of the film feels pretentious . It’s trying to go over as dark as it is and it dose and I’ll give the movie that it does try to achieve this tone but it’s so inconsistent. The villains are not the greatest and the taskmaster who’s a mercenary, has photographic memory in the comics is reduced to a walking robot and the twist and reveal is super obvious. Overall Black Widow isn’t really a satisfying film but is barely enjoyable . I give it a 6/10
",2
100734,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I was really looking forward to this movie and was sadly very disappointed. After the first hour (beginning was good and promising!), the ""story"" seemed to me and my audience, as very fragmented and there so many holes in the supposed plotline. Writing could have been SO much better. Sound editor should be fired, as the volume of the movie would increase significantly during the action sequences (which didn't make sense). The main character's sister Florence Pugh's 'Yelena Belova' was an enjoyable addition, and this actor is talented and seemed to get all of the best lines! So, in the opinion of my audience and myself, save your $ by not wasting your hard-earned money and view it, if you must, on streaming only (or DVD) with multiple people. Unfortunately, a few diehard Marvel fans were very disappointed in this film, especially after waiting for it for so long.",2
100735,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was great. The action scenes are entertaining and thrilling to watch. The humor in this movie is great, as well. Really hass a better sense of humor than other MCU movies. But the way some of the action shots were filmed, it made it just so hard to process. Plus, for me, it feels overhyped. I've been waiting for this movie a long time and had such high expectations going into theaters. But I was totally let down by the pacing, some of the shot angles, and even generally confused by the mind-control aspect. It wasn't really explained well. The main villain wasn't even explained well in my opinion. His motives felt lacking, the concept of his base felt odd, and there was just so many off-putting things happening. And don't get me started on the plot twist, that was way too predictable for me to enjoy. And finally, the thing I'm absolutely furious about: why was Twlight Sparkle in 1995? She didn't even have wings until 2015-ish. How'd she magically appear as a plushie 20 years prior?",2
100736,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I will try to be objective but sincerely: mix a little bit of Metal Gear Solid, the Bourne Identity, and Mission Impossible 4 and 5, but substitute them with indestructible women (seriously, not even a scratch or broken bones!), and you'll have as a result this film. It seems pretty much a lousy copy of Fast and Furious, and that is how bad it for me was. This film is a huge letdown; I feel bad because Scarlet Johanson is a terrific actress, and the black widow character has a lot to offer. But, it seems that this film purposely was looking to depict men as either useless, laughable tools or evil persons who only are looking to ""control women's minds"" (that only some red Disney magic dust can save). Genuinely, I was expecting an exciting and entertaining story. Some visual action scenes were fine, but this is a forgettable film.",2
100737,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I think the only reason this movie was made was to boost some feminist agenda. The reason Black Widow didn’t have a film in our original Marvel lineup is that her contributions are limited. She’s not a superhero— she’s a hired gun. And the movie reflects that. I would rather you skip the feminist agenda and make a movie because it deserves to be made; I could have gone without ever seeing this movie. It was like giving Gomorrah her own film; it’s just unnecessary. I like Black Widow in how she contributes to the group, not her alone. You didn’t even put Hawkeye in here and we know more about her love for him as family (she literally died for him) instead of these random people who were never mentioned until this film (why was she not talking about them to Steve during Endgame?) I’m all for inclusion and representation, but this is not it. :/",2
100738,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,I think that the movie was good but it should’ve been much better and had the potential to make characters like taskmaster as terrifying as the winter soldier in the 2nd captain America movie and black widows character isn’t supposed to be a funny person yet this movie insisted on having lots of comedy and they wasted red guardians character by making him a joke. And then Natasha herself didn’t even seem like the main character in her own movie. Since we it was set it the past the stakes weren’t as high since we knew what would happened basically. They also made taskmaster a one time villain when she easily should’ve appeared in more films and tv shows. The fights in the movie were also disappointing because they didn’t explore the hand to hand combat that they should’ve. Overall  for me a disappointment for what it could’ve been and should’ve been.,2
100739,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"As a fan of the character Natashạ/Black Widow, I couldn't wait for her solo movie to come out! And when it finally came out, after being delayed for so long, I am terrified to say it's totally disappointing, To watch her again being followed up by another storyline and a new case. When the movie should have been about how a girl became Black Widow. It is about how she reached Steve in Infinity War from CIvil War. Followed by a case of investigation which deals with her past. It would have been a great story for the second part of the BLACK WIDOW franchise not for the initiation. WE wanted her past to be explored not an investigation.",2
100740,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Probably one of the worst MCU films to date. I actually laughed out loud at several serious parts. And don't even get me started on the post credits scene, which sets up a conflict that could be resolved by a simple conversation. Florence Pugh and David Harbour give career high performances in the film though, so it has that going for it. Also really dislike what they did to Taskmaster",2
100741,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,Typical Hypocrisy of corporation we see daily life but just like them...we turn out to be biased ourselves despite believing that we're not. Ohh yeh marvel is awesome and we're not biased towards it. Look at the rotten tomatoes reviews...look at the rating. You're telling me that this is better than man of steel(40-50%) or even iron man 2 the movie where scar jo/natasha debuted. Pathetic. And I'm not even talking about all the other feminism stuff like people. Why can't we have a marvel/disney movie where the critics and auidience are as harsh and critical as they are when they're slaughtering the DCEU or some male dominant movie or some controversial movie like the Joker. I'm not saying the movie is trying to spread an agenda or anything and I don't have one of my own. Things happen....you want to make a cash grab and sometimes you screw up.I get it. But when I see the reviews of the film I demand to see honest opinions from the critics that claim to be unbiased and the auidience that claims to be against corporates and unbiased and open minded and tries to be rational in any part of their life but cinema coz that's where our agendas are made into heroes right.,1
100742,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Pretty disappointed. The plot was terrible. I mean like super low budget terrible. We spent the entire movie thinking “what the heck is going on?!” Action was okay and the actors were great. A movie like this should have been mind blowing! The cast was top notch. And it just crashed and burned due to poor writing. I was looking forward to seeing into who Black Widow was, this left me with way more questions. There’s no insight into the Red Room, her background or the relationship between Widow and Hawkeye. I felt like this was just a rush to get something out whilst trying to fit a plot line between 2 movies where the Avengers broke up. I could care less what was happening to Nat during that time. But what I did want to see is her past! The relationship she had with her sister her time in the Red Room and more of a reason to hate the villain. The days of good movies are over. Everything is just noise, explosions and pointless scenes. The action was not even enough to keep me awake. Spent the last 45 minutes fighting to keep my eyes open. I woke up and they were in a field of debris. I didn’t even bother to rewind what I missed. I just wanted it to be over so I could go to sleep. I love Scarlett Johansson, I enjoy her movies. But this just made me mad. Black Widow was done a disservice with this one. AVOID. Oh and make sure you watch past the credits. It will literally make you want to throw your remote into your TV. It is not Hawkeyes fault Natasha is dead. Shame on you Marvel.",1
100743,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"The film is good for feminist Americans who don’t care about reality, but for those who do just a little, they will feel embarrassed while watching the film. For example, what is it that the main villain (who is a white man anyway, but more on that later) lives in this cured hot air balloon which is the ""red room""? Any radar could be used to spot kilometers and shoot. Why didn't he go underground? And at a super gulag prison that they couldn't take down an old Mi-8 helicopter? As soon as they do not have at least one Shilka, they are produced in Russia for approx. 10 kg and $ 60,000 Igla missiles, so inexpensive that they can’t get a pair. Anyway, the film is about. there are only 3 male characters: the silly father who ""sold"" his daughters, the dude who gives everything for free but he still is in a friend zone, in fact, he is constantly being hurt mentally, and of course the main villain, who is a white, bald, Russian man. Not at all discrimination....",1
100744,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I love black widow, but this movie was ridiculous. Spoilers: It didn't really show her training in the red room other than a 30 second montage of all of the girls sitting in front of computer screens and learning martial arts. I wanted to see her standing out in the red room--small acts of defiance, better skills than the rest--something to set her apart. It didn't show her real mother, or how she met Clint. Or how she came to be with sheild. Her fake family's actions don't really fit with their characters. Nothing really fits. Where did the red smoke come from? And why would her fake mom help her after showing no remorse at giving her up in the first place. After developing mind control serum for all the little girls.... And come on, she was a scientist genius, how did she not figure out they were using it on the widows?? Once she found out and got angry, rthat would have given her more motivation and it would have been perfect if she had developed the red smoke that woke them up, then Natasha and Yelena releasing it. They should have shown the fake parents growing actually attached to the girls and the father should have got put into jail for resisting them being taken.Really disappointed.

100745,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Forgettable and mindless film, subpar acting and inconsistent CGI. A lot of action scenes had  choppy misplaced editing and unsynchronized cuts.  Forced dialogue and humor throughout the movie. Cringeworthy writing and a forced sister relationship doesn’t save it. So much pointless corny comedy bits that detracted from the plot. I also expected more from the Red Guardian but he barely does anything in the entire film. It doesn’t make you care about the characters. I also hate this version of Taskmaster. They ruined the taskmaster IP and lore. Doesn’t even feel like a MCU film, more so like a terrible spy movie. Some hopeless blind diehard MCU fans ate this up and praise it, you people have no standards. This is the worst MCU film in it’s entire chronology. I regret paying money to watch this in 3D, not worth watching in theaters. Not even worth streaming it illegally either. 2 hours dragged out and left the audience feeling disconnected and unimmersed. Weakest marvel entry by far, no contest.",1
100746,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,Amazing how they made a 200 million budget look like an episode of Hollyoaks. Scarlett Johansson looked so bloody bored throughout. The most animated she looked  was when she was hitting her head against a table. Which is what I was doing after paying to watch this. Martin Scorsese famously said Marvel movies were like theme park rides. If this was a ride it would be that one where Fabio had a bird fly into his face. Like a bird in the face avoid if you can. This film is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!! P.s who's that Craig David looking butler she has? His acting was hilarious,1
100747,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"Awful, CGI fest where the actors should have died 20 times half way through the film. Only the lead actress SJ do you develop any empathy for. The rest are throw-aways. Seems like these movies are nearly all computer fakery that makes it hard to care what happens to the actors. Bad script, assumptive leaps takes the movie from a promising start to about half way through you couldn't give a hoot and contemplate walking out. My GF loved it so it seems to be a love it or hate it film. In my mind the potential was there for a great BW movie. It just wasn't.",1
100748,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"I have seen almost every marvel and dc movie/tv show out there, and this by far my least favorite(even worse then the Ryan Reynolds Green lantern). The only reason I didn’t turn it off was because I was watching with my family. The acting wasn’t bad, but it was the plot that killed this movie. Only time I’ve ever wished for my money back on a marvel film. Smfh… I had so much hope after Wanda vision and Loki. I feel like the black widow(Scarlett Johansson) deserved a better movie. In addition, the cgi was trash, it was worse then the transformer movies cgi…I will watch it again to confirm… but I don’t think it will change my opinion…PS: I never leave a review on anything… if that says anything about how bad the plot was.",1
100749,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,Not impressed. After 2 years i was hoping something better from marvel but disappointed. Natashas character was the only down to earth superhero in the mcu and they had to go and bring cyborgs and cybertrucks to the mix. Not to mention the floating islands of pandora. Her backstory was incomplete. There was no portrayal of her training or her parents. Just bits and pieces here and there. Oh and can't forget the comedy element. Why would anyone mix comedy when they are trying at showing some kind of character development. It just dint go well with me. The cgi was mediocre. Action sequences reminded of watching the fast and furious series. I really wamted her character to have a better solo movie than this. But very disappointed. And what was that post credits scene. Could it have been any worse. I realize there should be some connection to the rest of the universe. But not like this marvel. Maybe it was the wait that got me full of hopes. But nevertheless this is my perspective and I AM NOT IMPRESSED.,1
100750,Black Widow,2021,Action/Adventure,"It's simply not good. Very disappointed because Black Widow is (or was, until this movie) an interesting character and had a lot of potential for a gripping back story. Instead it felt rushed, and the details of the Red Room are still vague even after watching the entire movie. I can't stand the ""Russian"" accents and I just feel like Marvel should stop attempting to make American actors do these because it takes away from the authenticity. There was too much corny humor in a movie that I thought was going to be pretty damn dark. It left me feeling disconnected from the characters and from the plot itself. Speaking of plot, it was just so flat and predictable. The acting sucked, and I guess Disney didn't trust Scarlett enough to carry the movie on her own which is why all the supporting characters were brought in. It was boring and didn't add any dimension to her character at all.",1
100751,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Enjoyed this movie so much I went home and watched the original scream movie right after, and caught even more similarities. I think this movie pays homage to the original in  some nostalgic ways. It is a very self aware film, which I loved. The original Scream’s purpose is about breaking the mold of common horror tropes, so having them be part of this movie too, in such a manner that they were, I found ironic and funny. The comments about “out of touch old directors that don’t understand young audiences”- I don’t get. I’m young, I enjoyed it, the fact that you all expect a group of teens to be “in touch with reality” is where you’re wrong lol. Yes, it probably could’ve been better in some way or another, but I would gladly go see it again. I recommend this! It had some good prosthetic death scenes (”real” blood/wounds, not that CGI junk) and I had a good time guessing “who done it?” ",5
100752,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Don’t really understand the bad reviews. It’s a slasher movie, it’s not going to be the best movie you’ve ever seen so you get what you expect. It was much better than my expectations though. I loved how there was a comedy aspect like there was in scream 4, but they didn’t overdo it. There was a lot of gore obviously but it wasn’t horrible, a few of the deaths were a little unrealistic but that’s a slasher film for you! Don’t know how anyone can survive like 20 stab wounds all over their body but yea. The beginning was also great, it captured the same feel of the original Scream’s open scene by making it incredibly modern day and perfectly captured Gen Z at its finest in Tara’s character. I highly recommend watching this if you just want a stupid but well written slasher film, it also takes shots at other scream movies too which I thought was funny.Now for the ****KINDA SPOILER PART****  So I liked how it hinted at a specific common twist throughout the movie, which almost made me doubt my original stance on who the killer was. Obviously the ending was predictable but the movie did a good job on swaying your opinion, it also bought back old characters if you were wondering at all. Rip
",5
100753,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"What a great way to start 2022! This film definitely delivers especially the new characters who are actually really great. The kills are brutal which is what I love about horror movies. The performances and cast were great, the twists and turns where awesome and the 4th wall breaking was also really great and hilarious even though they did it too much. Scream is my all-time favorite film and I'm very impressed with this one. My 2nd favorite in the series. The only thing I'll say is that is pays tribute to the original masterpiece and Wes Craven's legacy that he created. By the way, David Arquette knocks it completely out the park & was my favorite part of the film. 10/10.",5
100754,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Absolutely enjoyed every minute worth watching this film! Easily my favorite of the whole franchise followed of course by the original Scream. Met all expectations going into this film, acting was superb, plot was unexpected and almost jumped completely out of my seat several times throughout. If you are looking for a quick scare edge of your seat type of movie, you have picked the right movie! Easily 5/5 stars for my critic rating. Highly recommended for those who are fans of this franchise, I would encourage those who are easily frightened to watch with the lights turned on and hold on to your seat because it will be a bumpy ride throughout.",5
100755,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"As Randy Meeks said in Scream 2, ""Carnage-Candy"", That's exactly what this new Scream movie is; the one every fan deserves. It has been a decade we witnessed the last Scream movie and I was amused to see that ‘Radio Silence’ had reins this time. After Craven, couldn’t think of another better filmmaker(s) to direct this franchise. The movie is funny, well-acted, brilliantly shot, right amount of easter eggs , brutal kills, bold choices, graphic and nailed the whole meta and tongue-in-cheek humour. I was impressed how the makers seamlessly achieved the transition and shift of focus from legacy characters to the new ones. Sid, Gale and Dewey never once seemed shoe-horned. And that third act at Stu Macher’s house. That’s all I am gonna say. The finale is crazy and keeps the suspense going. Easily my favourite after the first one. I guess studio and makers of the new Matrix should take cues from this movie and crew on how to handle a requel. All hail, the ghost face. We welcome you back. It is an honour!!!

100756,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I've never been a huge fan of the genre/franchise, but for the first 'rebrand' of 2022 it's a plethora of nostalgia, comedy, and mild gore! With some fantastic slasher scenes, the effects are subtle without being stomach turning but should still sate the fans of the brand. Much like any movie of its type the only down side is the predictability. I'd give it 4.5 but rounded up for the amount it made me laugh as it took the mick out of itself for the duration. As someone who hasn't watched the entire back catalogue I'm sure some of the inside jokes went over my head. I don't, however, feel this took anything away from my enjoyment. Though I would say if you don't know the premise and content of at least the original, you'll be missing out a bit.It's hard to say anything else without spoilers so I'll leave it there 😂

100757,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"As a true fan of the OG Scream (1996) and someone only mildly interested (and quite critical) of the follow-ups, with part 2 being the exception, I have to say that this movie surpassed my expectations!  My concern was that without Wes Craven's involvement, there's no way they'd ever be able to re-capture the feeling of the first one. I was wrong.  The cast was fantastic all the way around but Jack Quaid clearly stood out and was absolutely brilliant! He brought much of the same energy and feel that Matthew Lillard did in the original. I won't spoil anything here, but if you're a fan of the first one, do yourself a favor and go see this movie.",5
100758,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I don't know how people gave this movie 4 stars, i mean this is a slasher movie with obvious killer (ghostface) and the job is to find the killers in the group. I think this one is a 5 stars movie, all the casts are AMAZING! Bringing courteney cox, neve campbell and david arquette to the game is absolutely great and i really loved it. I was so excited watching it from the beginning until the end, all scenes are great, none of them are boring for me. You guys should definitely watch it, such a good thriller movie for opening 2022!",5
100759,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Had an absolutely lovely time!! Darien our server was outstanding!! The chain has made a reputation for offering delicious Italian cuisine,certainly happy  they did not disappoint. The wine selection is extensive, the menu is also well thought out. I enjoyed the overall experience!! With so many restaurants failing we are so glad they have survived the current climate. Darien again did a fabulous job, as he made a difference in the overall experience.  We recommend Maggiano's in San Paulo. We will return!!",5
100760,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I let in sink in a day to determine how much I liked this as the movie went so fast and I was waiting quite some time for this movie.  That being said, one day later and time to think, this movie was great and the best outside of the original.  The cast is amazing and the kills are very brutal, I wasn't sure how I felt about the motive until I simmered and it and now that I did, I LOVE it.  You will never be able to replicate the originality of 1996 but this did Scream amazing justice and is the perfect ""requel"" to move forward.  I know they filmed 5 endings to this movie, it will be interesting to see if they include them when it hits DVD but I can't imagine they didn't pick the right one.",5
100761,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Just got back from seeing it now and to be honest, I don't want anymore. It was fun, but highly upset about 2 scenes. 4/5 for me. OG3 was the best part for me, kills were more brutal on Olivia's level. Liked 2 or 3 of the newbies. Ghostface was on point. But reveal and motive. 😬🙆🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️Just updating, after a second viewing the motive played better for me, I think I was just overwhelmed the first watch. 🙈🤣",4
100762,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"The film was overall really good. It is not as campy or funny as previous scream movies. It is very serious and gory unlike any of the movies in the franchise. The movie lacked the dramatic opening scene that the rest of the scream movies always have. It was good but doesn't make your jaw drop. The ending scene which had suprising killers, lack the crazed emotion and hatred that the other killers have had. The killer reveal is always the best part of the movie but the performances were dry. The action at the ending made up for the lack of acting.  Overall it was a really good movie.",4
100763,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Way better than I thought it would be. Definitely better than 3 and 4. Some parts were really badly acted/written. And some parts felt really gruesome and cruel, but I think that's how a slasher movie should be. Overall the movie felt like a love letter to Wes Craven and the franchise as a whole.",4
100764,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,Was supposed to work but the Illinois blizzard cancelled that so I decided to go alone and catch an early showing of this movie. I’ll make it quick and easy. Was a fun movie that did bad and good. That’s all I gotta say about it. Some goofy moments forsure but a lot of it was definitely entertaining. Go watch if you’re a fan of the scream franchise. “For Wes” 🔥,4
100765,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Appreciated the, ""back to their roots"" storytelling. They produced a nostalgic, 90s style slasher flick while poking fun at themselves without overdoing it, or relying on social commentary to elevate the storyline. Perfect date night movie Wes would have been proud of. Do it for Dewey.",4
100766,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I'm not a slasher film fan, so there were times when I genuinely had to look away from the screen because of all the gore. But the end fight scene was kind of iconic. Its a silly fun movie in my opinion. Fun to watch with your friends. Kind of makes fun of fans of slasher films.",4
100767,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Scream (2022) is a near perfect Sequel that does everything it can to serve as both a love letter to what came before whilst also being determined to do something new and set itself apart and in that regard, I feel this film very much succeeds with moments for Fans new and old alike, with twists and turns you won't see coming. This film really will leave you asking ""What's your favourite Scary Movie?""",4
100768,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I just watched Scream 5, and I'm NOT disappointed. It's a really good thriller. A lot of suspense, some comedy, and a little bet of drama. If you like the original Scream (first part) you definitely will like this sequel. Four solid stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐",4
100769,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,Even tho it’s a bit predictable I still thought it was a great movie and it definitely has some of the most savage kills in the series. It also has good cinematography and does a good job at keeping you guessing who the killer is throughout,4
100770,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"The actual rating i'd give is 4 in a half stars.To keep it short,As a big time scream fan,it wasn't the masterpiece i was expecting,but what it is is a great bonkers,entertaining,crowd-pleasing,respectful horror movie that still carries the rapid-fire meta commentary,hilarious banter,exciting kills,great character moments and the ability to still shock in surprise.A very worthy addition to a timeless franchise and a damn great horror in its own right,and we could always need more of those.",4
100771,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Entertaining twist on the franchise.  Generally well acted.  Tara pulls out every bad stereotype of a teen in distress (spoiler alert embedded), excessive tears, and yips which make almost zero sense as she was being pursued by the killer and was in hiding.   Mason Gooding should NEVER play a high school guy again, I mean come on, the guy is already at district attorney age and his is a good looking man not teen.   Skeet Ulrich makes numerous cameos with a digitized face lift to make him as young as his original character and the original cast member returning made for a nice  twists.  Fun and keeps you guessing til the end.",3
100772,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"the installments continues. 25 years later a new ghostface emerges in woodsboro and the remaining trio from the last 4 films have a reunion and come back to there home town to face off yet another killer or killers. better than i thought it would be. suspenseful, good amount of tension acting is superb, very funny and it has new rules for those in the film to mandatory go by. but is routine, juvenile and more over the top blood & gore than most of the other installments. but if you're looking for a good roller coaster ride and you like the scream franchise it's worth it. jenna ortega and mikey madison are highlighted standouts! a 8 out of 10.",3
100773,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"The problem was the hospital scene where there were no staff members present - with Tara alone pleading for help and the only people that where there was the killer who had access to the main power. The ending would've been perfect if psychotic Stu made a surprise reveal as the killer, which would've made a perfect piece to the puzzle. I feel like Sidney and other actors didn't bring more passion and dedication to their acting skills which personally felt bland. The graphic gore was perfect and probably better than the previous sequels. I love the originality of the film which paid tribute to the 1996 release and tribute to the best director himself ""Wes Craven""",3
100774,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Big time scream fan, honest think the second is the best each to there own. I’m on my 30s so this was true slasher flick when I was in teens. It still follows the mindless whodunnit, keeps you guessing for a fair while but run out of people to assume because accountability gets either to far or to obvious. Feels like there’s a lot of backhanded comments towards old fans. Over all I was happy enough with the film, the biggest mistake of the whole movie was the ending, not to say the writing of that ending is bad, just doesn’t fit the place, was almost cringy. Pretty close to being the least favourite, just didn’t feel as involved as previous screams",3
100775,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Another decade, another Scream installment, now in current release. 11 years have passed since the last Wes Craven entry & it appears the Ghost Face killer has now restarted his (they?) killing spree w/the first victim, played by Jenna Ortega, is menaced via phone at home (shades of Drew Barrymore’s death from the first film) until she is stabbed multiple times & surprisingly not killed prompting her estranged sister, played by In the Heights Melissa Barrera, to come from out of town w/her boyfriend, The Boys’ Jack Quaid, to visit her at the hospital where she’s healing up & also meeting her expanse of friends (who will soon be victims or revealed to be the killers behind this latest slew of slaughters) who have some ties to the original O.G.’s (Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox & David Arquette). Mixing up newcomers & returning participants from previous entries (Marley Shelton from part 4, Heather Matarazzo from part 3), the film works in fits & starts but it does miss the Craven touch (which this film is dedicated to) w/his elegant framing & tense murder scenes but being we’re in the realm of the reboot, re-imagining, re-whatever, more of these are coming down the pike (the concluding Halloween chapter is due, I read Jeepers Creepers is getting a reboot) it all comes down to the viewer; want to invest in your nostalgia spend away.",3
100776,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I would hope to think that I'm talking for everyone when I say that although it was a good movie, it was a huge missed opportunity. Stu should have been back for sure. Also, if Tara can survive 7 critical stabs, I would wanna believe Dewey could survive the like 4-5 stabs. I know it looked like Deweys was worse but if you really go back and compare it was pretty much identical. Finally, how tf do they have a girl that was on-screen for 2 seconds be the one that takes Dewey down, there is nothing about that that makes since. It would've been the best movie of 2022 if they would've just made Stu the killer, and his reasoning being Billy gets all the credit for the kills that night. This is of course on top of his original reasoning in scream 1. There were so many parts that like confirmed Stu coming back so it was just such a disappointment not seeing him.",3
100777,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"It’s really hard to beat the original, but it’s better then 2, 3, and 4. I could never figure out who the killer is, which I’m the “you watch it already” kind of guy, when I haven’t watched it at all. I want to say that Mickey Madison was top notch she did so amazing in this movie she killed it, she could have been in the original, she is so good at acting. I would like to see Mickey Madison in more movies she did so great.",3
100778,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"The casual viewer such as myself may not care so much about behind the scenes making-of-a-movie rants that they do frequently. I think they were really trying to advertise within the movie - a separate movie on Netflix. They said Netflix a combined about 3-4 times during one scene. Due to these awkward rants and Netflix advertisements it broke the immersion. The movie had time to talk about something or bring about character development - and this is what they chose to talk about. Boring.Boring is a good word to describe all parts that don't involve someone getting stabbed by Mr/Ms ghostface. That may be okay enough to kill some time on a Friday night. The ending sequence was cheesy. But hey, there's stabbing, there's blood, and it's about what I expected.
",3
100779,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,I enjoyed watching the movie. I don’t pay attention to there sayings I only pay attention to the scenes cuz it’s better than listening to the whole cussing in every scene . I will miss Dewey😔 He was a funny and cool dude. It wouldn’t be the same without him. I love Sidney. No one messes with her. She’s Sidney Prescott.,3
100780,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"The film was a great addition to the series. It was scary, intense, emotional, and definitely honored the original. However, I was disappointed with the reveal; almost way too obvious....just from poster. I really lile that they didn't make Dewey doofy and the relationship between Sidney and Gale was perfect; just enough and not over kill. It's as if Scream 4 was completely unnecessary. However, I am upset its always the same exact motive of every killer (except Scream 2). The writing was lazy at the end. Othewise, I'm pleased. Oh and by the way, is it possible that not one person is in the hospital?",3
100781,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I’m honestly convinced that the outstanding reviews on this film are either by people who have never seen a good movie in their lives or people who have been paid by the producers to leave them. I’ll be honestly, I bought into all the hype at the very beginning myself. However, after witnessing this film, I’m left severely underwhelmed. The criteria of a slasher isn’t hard to meet, what sets apart an okay slasher from a good one are when plot holes are patched up towards the end. This movie does none of the above. Although the cast did the best they could with this highly predictable script, the film still fell short in a lot of areas. What is the point of having the movies characters aware of the slasher rules if they still don’t follow them? You’d have a character verbally say how stupid an action was and YET would still perform the action. The movies characters acted as if they were in a video game, like they had multiple lives to spare therefore they never truly acted as if their lives were in danger. Also I can tell that disconnected adults wrote this film because for some odd reason, after the teens friends are attacked and one even murdered….THEY THROW A PARTY!! In what universe does that make the slightest bit of sense? I left the theatre angered by how a movie that was made in 1996 still managed to outdo one in 2022. The original produced likable characters and bonds that you could root for while this new adaptation made me feel nothing. The relationships were clearly artificial and lacked any substance. My final point being, a slasher is usually done by a notorious killer or one that has yet to be revealed. Within movies that have mystery murderers, it’s known to keep the audience guessing until the end. I lie to you not, within the first 25 minutes of the movie, I knew exactly who the two killers were.",2
100782,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"LITERALLY MY COUSIN AND I CAME UP WITH A BETTER STORYLINE THEN THEY DID….. we’ve loved the original scream for a while now and had high expectations for the new movie but was sadly disappointed.. we wish that stu was mentioned more than once as he was an original killer not just BILLY yes billy was a good killer but stu has also played apart of the killings and the original scream movie..getting more of an understanding of how characters where related to the originals and where the hell was Billy’s secret girlfriend at? How did billy even get the chance to cheat on Sidney when he was so obsessed with her, would’ve made way more sense if it was Sidney’s long lost child… Dewey’s death was quite upsetting as he is the one that brought the originals all together and yet gets murdered by a teenage girl!! That had been shot! And “magically” recovered… if they do make a new scream please give it a better storyline, script and for stu to actually be mentioned more than once!! We don’t need another corny remake",2
100783,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"No character development or real plot, very little suspense, predictable jump scares and excessively unrealistic, with teenage girls overpowering grown men. I didn't expect it to be good, but I hoped at least for a few decent scenes. There was none, and the story itself was boring. Tara (played by Jenna Ortega) Is a phenomenal young actress, and her along with Dewey (David Arquette) were the lone bright spots, but unfortunately their screen time was limited. The first Scream was a masterpiece, and even 2 and 3 were decent, but this one was by far the worst in the the franchise, and nowhere even remotely close to what Wes Craven would've wrote. Only reason for the 2 stars were cause Ortega and Arquette really did a great job. Keep an eye on Jenna, I'd expect her to get some decent roles after this performance. Really a wonderful young actress.",2
100784,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I will be honest I don't really watch the scream films and this is the 2nd one besides the original that I've seen so far and the gore is passable but not amazing the scares are so boring and very predictable that I felt like sleeping to the point I was really wondering if this film was even trying to be scary not only that but I even heard a kid in the audience before the film even started (FYI the showing was very small no more than probably 20+ people so I couldn't mistake him) and that kid didn't even yell or scream which shows how noncary this film was the characters felt meh and didn't mean much if they died the and I haven't even talked about the reasoning about the killers actions its soooooo stupid that I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time it's felt like a fanfic some weird horror nerd would have and you can't just say the killers where just insane that card has been played so much its becoming annoying. Out of all the newer horror reboots this has to be one of the worst. In short the gore isn't intense, the scares are predictable, and the plot for the killers actions are so laughably bad. And if the spelling is bad I don't care because I don't want to waste my time thinking about this film",2
100785,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I honestly hate to say it, but this was one of the most disappointing moments of my life LMAO. I grew up watching the franchise and the way Scream 4 ended was perfect in my opinion. This movie was BEYOND corny and pointless. I am genuinely besides myself and feel like this movie was taken from a wattpad fanfiction. I prefer to pretend this movie never happened. With that being said, seeing the big three on screen was nice. The kills were pretty good and the references we nice to see. I give it a 4/10 maybe a 5/10. I probably will watch it one more time in its entirety and then never again.",2
100786,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Scream will always be classy slasher/comedy movie and with the return of Sidney, Gail and Dewey makes it worth while. Since Wes Craven's death, Scream 5 honors his legacy and into dudes us to new characters. The downside is like Halloween and Friday the 13th franchises, as,interesting and self aware as,the movie is, did we really need a ""requel?"" WATCH the original if you want to see a,good SCREAM movie",2
100787,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I dont feel as if they had to kill dewey off. Heres one of my theories i had thought. They were supposed to shoot the killer in the head. In the first movie they didnt shoot stew in the head. I wish he wouldve come back no new characters stew, sidney, monica, dewey im so sad that they killed of dewey i am upset. If this is the ladt movie i will cry. Could you make it to where that was the wrong body bag and dewey wasnt in there he just had to recover. I dont know just please dont kill off sid, gale, and dewey! I beg you bring my childhood back. In my opinion you didnt make him proud. Just me or does anybody else wanna hear the iconic ""hello Sidney""",2
100788,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"2 Stars for the 2 moments that I might have accidentally burst out a laugh at something either wildly unbelievable or surprisingly humorous or both. Overall this film is a very slow-moving, non-climactic, predictable display of nonsensical scenes with extremely bad writing. At no point does the film come close to drawing you in. It almost feels like they want the audience to stay on the outside, peaking into what could have been an engaging thriller, but instead you may find yourself like me, halfway through the movie, more excited to write a bad review than endure the remainder of this literal “horror film” (pun intended).",2
100789,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,It was a rip off of an original.  Boring and    predictable.  The only good thing was bringing back original characters from Wes Craven's films.  I think the franchise should be left alone already. It will never be the same without Craven's vision. True fans may have loved all the references to original movie but deep down can't  escape how generic this one felt.,2
100790,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I was really excited to see this movie I have been a huge fan of the scream movies since I saw the first one in the theaters 25 years ago however this one has got to be my least favorite movie in the series they tried too hard to get you to care about the characters which fell flat, they tried too hard to beef up the killing scenes which also felt too phoney and not entertaining the killer/killers were dull they tried to replace the characters from the original scream with new actors which was boring, the inclusion of the legacy characters felt too forced all in all this movie was a mess the format has been laid out by Wes craven all they had to do was follow the formula he perfected with the previous entries in the series and they failed they also tried too hard to be self aware which made it more annoying then anything and the jokes in the movie missed with everyone in the theater I went to wait for it to come to a streaming service not worth the cost of a movie ticket very disappointed in this movie",2
100791,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"D-U-M-B cash grab of a movie, disingenuously “winking” at the audience about its own sequels. The writing was boring, the actors unattractive and forgettable, and most of the scenes were completely implausible in real life. (Spoilers) A police chief being stabbed in front of her home in broad daylight AFTER backup had been called? A knife fight, with multiple people being stabbed, out in the open, in an unusually, completely empty hospital (but in the morning its miraculously again packed with people)? Sydney now apparently works as a spy for the CIA because she can attach “tracking” devices to cars and track them via gps. And now we get the LGBTQ aspect to the script - something the previous films was apparently missing? But wait! We also get a mid-movie throwback to re-introduce our now 50-something, Botox-faced female heroes to save the day. Yay! Just what I wanted - six females in the end (the boyfriend might as well been a female), creating “horror” - not. Oh yeah, and before you leave the theater, don’t forget how inspiring it can be to have a serial killer ghost dad, m-Kay? I was seriously hoping to see a goofy faced Matthew Lillard under that goofy faced ghost mask. Maybe next time…",1
100792,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,Never been so disappointed in a movie. Wes craven would be so upset btw SPOILERS it would of made more sense to make Sam Billy Loomis daughter as the killer. But then again maybe not cause the killers weren't going after Sydney right away but i still think the killers were stupid and taking out Dewey that was just unnecessary like they could of taken Gale but Then again Wes Craven didn't write or direct it so makes sense why it was so horrible. Best parts in my opinion were the few little glimpses of Billy showing up if that tell yall anything. And im also highly upset they took Out Dylan 😭💯 2.5\10,1
100793,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,Why? I ask myself why? I wanted to see the old cast brought back together in probably the final making of the Scream movies. I wanted to see Neve Campbell one last time play her part. I wanted to see Dewey and Gail Weathers but all we got is a mixed story line and new unfamiliar faces that never grew on me the entire movie I was so bored and disappointed with how they made this. And why is the 13 reason why guy have the ugliest hair color in this movie? It was driving me nuts. ☺️ I was so disappointed in this movie like why even try to make some boring story line that made no sense like how did Billy end up with a daughter? Strange weird and never mentioned or hinted in the other screams. Neve why did you even agree to this dumb version of your amazing versions of scream? 🤦‍♀️ Don’t waste your time watching this it will kill the good feelings about how Scream 4 ended just think of Scream 4 as the ending of the series! Also why weren’t they calling it Scream and kept calling them “stab” movies? Stab was the name of the opening movie that the movie characters were watching? So confused don’t waste your time you will HIGHLY disappointed.,1
100794,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"I’m sorry to say, but I absolutely hated this film.  I found more enjoyment staring at my empty popcorn bowl.  If you want what was basically a complete reboot (or as they call it, a “requel”), with the same ending you got with the other films, with the bonus of some added annoying and useless characters, go ahead and waste your money.  This film is following every other films method these days…draw in the old fans by throwing up every bit of nostalgia and Easter egg you can muster, and then drop the grenade on the rest.  Save your time and rewatch the first original and classic Scream.",1
100795,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"By far the most predictable and dumbest installment of the franchise. It took a huge step backwards in my opinion, the killer is so predictable and not to mention an unnecessary major character death. The scene itself was lackluster too for a character that survived 4 installments of the franchise to die a disappointing death that wasn’t worth it and by someone you know that would never be able to kill them is just so dumb! I’m all for a reboot but why bring back main cast members just to kill them off. I’m a huge fan of this franchise, and I mean huge fan scream was always my favorite slasher horror movie but this new installment just left a bad taste in my mouth and made me think twice about them rebooting/ soft rebooting a popular franchise!",1
100796,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"This is terrible. So many horrible bits to discuss. It actually hurt my head to watch it. Not sure how to list all the horrible elements. The overused ""open fridge door, close fridge door and killer is there"", the wack attempted humour one liners after a killing, the token characters, the constant movie plot explanations, the scenes where everyone in the room takes a turn at adding information, the repeated ""maybe you're the killer"" quotes, the pathetic references to the original, the rubbish references to the faux horror series shown within the movie, Courtney's top lip.....wow...I was scared it was going to crumble, the contrived ""girl power"" scenes at the end....maybe worst quote of all was the ""enjoy that torch"". The movie is so bonkers it's ridiculous. This is easily in my worst 5 movies of all time. 1 star given only because can't give 0 or 0.5. Stay away from this movie.",1
100797,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"This movie was total garbage.The overall plot was trash,and some things didn't even make sense. Tara(14 years old) stay in a big house all by herself because her dad died and her mother is in rehab..and her sister moved away so she is living alone with no supervision. The hospitals in that area have NO PATIENTS AND ONLY 2 SECURITY OFFICERS  ALSO NO STAFF?! The killers motives in the end sound as lame and aren't a real reason to start a whole movie.Everything was just so cliche that you would think that it would be something different but it's as predictable as predictable can be.This movie is a waste of time.",1
100798,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Arguably one of the worst scream movie periods it’s worse than scream 4 , this movie felt cheap and the killers were way too obvious in this movie not to mention that this movie was supposed to be more realistic compared to other screams like scream 3. It was not realistic the killer got lit on fire but was still able to walk until she got shot in the head and the whole thing felt rushed and a waste of time . To be honest the only reason why I wanted to watch this movie is because I believed Stu would return as ghostface but he didn’t not going to spoil anything but the killers were terrible in this movie and this film would be better off of never released. 0/10",1
100799,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,"Potential Spoilers?: The only good thing about this movie was the gore and the fact they brought back original cast from the original Scream. I'm disappointed at the fact that it feels like I read a wattpad story written by a 15 year old girl. I was really excited to watch it because although I knew it wasn't going to compare to the first movie, I didn't expect it to be so bad. I won't rant about it forever but genuinely I could've gone my whole life without watching it, too many fake ""jump scare"" moments and too stupid of a killer reveal to actually make watching the movie enjoyable.",1
100800,Scream,2022,Horror/Thriller ,Absolute waste of money. No hard story line. I have not watched any other scream movies but I feel it could have been so much better. The movie has scenes jumping from one to another. Felt like I was watching a 2nd grade movie. Just my opinion!,1
100801,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I am seeing a lot of hate comments which I don't understand why. The movie was amazing the message of the film was loud and clear., not every whimsical wish can be granted, and there is no shortcut to truth. Gal gadot has done a great job, motherly and kind sense and the pain of loosing the only thing had wished for was so deep from the soul. Amazing and her boyfriend Chris pine was amazing. Such a magical and emotional movie it is at the same time delivering an extremely strong and a realistic message which I think everyone is failing to understand and hence wrong comments. This movie has been made with a lot of hard work. I became a fan of Gal gadot. 💛🧡💚💙❤🧡💛💛💛💚💙",5
100802,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I was expecting a bad movie from all the bad reviews but I loved it. It was entertaining, I laughed, I cried and I enjoyed the action. Obviously it's not like the comics but it does reference so many things from the comics but in a new way. It's a great movie my family and I enjoyed very much. And to be set in the 80s that was awesome!! (I was born in 1984, so yeah this is freaking awesome). I remember watching Wonder Woman with Lynda Carter when I was a kid and even though she played the character in the 70s it was a big hit in the 80s too so it was cool to bring it back to that time. Also the very ending after some of the credits omg!! It blew my mind.",5
100803,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,Brilliant movie from start to finish. The movie is the perfectly balanced mix of emotion and action with some excellent sublimal messages on being careful what we wish for. Gal Gadot remains powerful and awesome and yet wonderfully vulnerable. I thought Kristen wiig was a very well fleshed transformation. This movie is a lesson in different kinds of braveness least of the lessons being a covid release. I hope it does well because it deserves to.,5
100804,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"As a big Wonder Woman fan, I found this film enjoyable and fun to watch. The film felt very inspired by the original Christopher Reeve Superman 80s films and therefore was in fact a bit cringy at times. However this is no different then similar vibes of WW, Batman or Superman films or series from the 80s. I saw it in IMAX and loved it. I would reccomend the film to others, if you're a big comic book fan there are some fun easter eggs or call backs in the film.",5

I, personally, think it was better than the first one. It's an incredible film with some excellent cameos. The costuming was outstanding! Definitely something to inspire, not just young girls, but women and men of all ages! 10/10 would recommend!!",5
100808,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,I enjoy the movie and it is worth while to watch. I enjoy the plot and the story is well done. As I think about the plot I cannot notice plot holes that would ruin this movie. Visual well done and acting is great. How they bring back Chris Pines character Steve is a brilliant idea and does help with the plot and helps make the story meaningful in many ways. It helps adds more to Gal’s Wonder Woman character and I am looking forward for another movie if they ever make another one.,5
100809,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Great movie, I think the plot is mimicking how we live our lives wishing for something greater or to be better than someone we think is doing better than us... But in the end if we all get our wishes or get what we want, there is always a cost or price to pay. It shows us to stay with the path the universe takes us through, everyone has their path and that is what makes our destiny. I love how it has been portrayed in the movie. Ww84 is a must watch!",5
100810,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Before watching it, I heard this movie had bad reviews and I don't know why. My wife and I had a great time with this movie. The pace was good and we were not bored. You get to see part of the comics that were not introduced in the previous installment, it has action and I think it has a good plot, which is different from many plots I've seen. A great movie to watch with the family and those you care. I would watch it again.",5
100811,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"4/5 It was good, i'd definatly recommend the movie to friends, the acting by was the cast was great, the main character is just very lovable person with no flaws in personality (some may argue this is a bad thing), and while i'm not invested in super hero movies i was moved by this film and the acting, some parts were emotional and i feel they pulled it off quite well. The fight scenes were pretty cool and held a lot of suspence within the scenes, with build up making each fight nearing the end of the movie more and more exiting and intense, i was on the edge of my seat throughout the film, i thought that some parts looked a bit unrealistic, which ended up with me kinda taken out of the film for a second but emersed back in just as quickly. As for the plot, it could be better, by the time the plot really started rolling i was invested in the characters but there were still many plot holes that weren't answered by the time the movie finished it was very clear who the villains were from the start even before they revealed it, and as for their motives it was a bit blurry, you can obviously read all the reviews you want to decide if you want to watch the movie or not but all i say is to just do it, watch it to form your own opinions, its only two hours long and you either enjoy it or you stop watching, personally i enjoyed it and would gladly watch it again  because it still did its job of adding some exitment to my day, theres nothing really to lose, so watch it for yourself. Thanks for reading.",4
100812,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,Wonder woman 1984 is a beautiful film that’s more about the greed of man and how having everything you could every want will not make you happy and less about big action scenes. It’s about facing your truth and not distracting yourself to cope with it. It’s about having an egomaniac narcissist who has clearly been hurt in his past come into a lot of power which is extremely relevant. It’s about love and selflessness. A lot of people can learn from that these days. It’s visually stunning and Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman! Kristen Wiig is amazing as cheetah. Chris Pine’s banter with Gal Gadot is always amazing to see and the scene between them toward the end was too much in a good way. Pedro Pascal’s Max Lord Couldn’t have been played any better. Yes the movie is not perfect but is not as bad a people are making it out to be at all. However I do wish that there were more action scenes between wonder woman and cheetah. I still think that the original film is a masterpiece but this film is a close second. it’s a love letter to the Linda Carter series which is a part of wonder woman’s history and is embraced in this film. I think that went over a lot of peoples heads.,4
100813,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"To compare Patty Jenkins' WONDER WOMAN 1984 to THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 and BATMAN FOREVER is criminal...Kristen Wiig's portrayal of Cheetah is way better than those forgettable villains of Jamie Foxx's Electro and Jim Carrey's Riddler.  Hers was more layered and great acting, and the transition narrative from friend to foe was just clever scriptwriting.  We understand that, yeah, Patty Jenkins & company took the easy route to a sequel using (to quote Chris Stuckman) ""an extreme cliché entrope of some of the more cheesy superhero films we've got in the past""—however, one can not deny that WONDER WOMAN 1984, together with SPIDER-MAN 2, are the exceptions here, succeeding in spades where ""movies in the past"" in this category miserably failed.  Our hats are off to Patty Jenkins & company for making a movie ""in this category"" that makes up for the ""sins"" of past movies ""in this category""...WONDER WOMAN 1984 is amazing in every way, in that, what didn't work for 1984's SUPERGIRL and SUPERMAN 4: QUEST FOR PEACE then, Patty Jenkins pulled it off with this WW sequel, unofficially making this film a ""mea culpa"" from WB in botching a potential lucrative franchise in OG 1978 SUPERMAN.",4
100814,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Wonder Woman 84 seemed so ""human,"" really nailed the classic 80s, full of color and touchy—a super-pure joy to watch, accompanied by many cool moments that happened. Gal Gadot, Pedro Pascal, and Kristen Wiig fit the characters they play. The storyline is simple, close to human life in general, and emphasizes drama rather than action. Patty Jenkins does give this film an emotional touch with a very good message. Not to be missed, Hans Zimmer's scoring splendor was unbeatable. Overall, the comeback moment to the cinema was not in vain.",4
100815,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Enjoyed this film. Wishing for more sequels. Anyone criticizing, please dont ruin the joy some have. Its nice to simply sit back and watch these characters and a simple and fun story. Good thing there wasn't so much drama back in the day when comics were being made.  We wouldnt get to see a second volume if all caved into all of this competition and negativity. Know one language and a handful of repetitive words and some people write a novel in reviews section. Just watch and enjoy without assuming you were born to direct an impossible to impress story. I just would love a whole bunch of these movies, so that 5-10 years from now I can enjoy the lot, without missing the fact that they couldn't make anymore movies thanks to some excellent critics ruining the fun for all.",4
100816,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Watch it. Don’t follow what others are saying, your opinion is the only one you should stand for. Like it or not-I gotta say it was interesting, it was obviously not the best but it had some clear entertainment, message, and positivity. Realistic? It’s a DC movie what do you expect. I am honestly just grateful that we got a sequel and a new movie in general. I usually don’t write reviews but the fact that a majority of people that rated this movie didn’t necessarily like it, and are; let’s not say “hating,” is kind of the downfall for this movie. I mean of course the movies not ‘legendary,’ but the source of this whole movies entertainment circles to the audiences’ opinion. I’m nor defending this movie or disliking it, because we’re entitled to our own feelings on it. Some of us have been here for all the DC movies and origins, so it’s no surprise that people may or may not be dissatisfied with this movie. I’m not going into anymore detail than I already have, the film (in my opinion) was watch worthy, give it a go.",4
100817,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,It has beautiful visuals and and some great action scenes. Powerful acting but an underwhelming story development. I just feel like we didn't get to know her frenemies well enough to be emotionally impacted the way they were other than Steve Trevor/Diana. The mid credits scene was cool too! Definitely worth the watch either way you go about it but with HBOMAX for a month and ww84 it's too tempting not too watch it from home considering the virus and all.,4
100818,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I thought the dynamics between the characters were genuine and heartfelt, not to mention the action was cool as always. I do feel the storyline was a bit cliche and they delved into the corniness a little too much sometimes. It also feels like they shied away for the more violent stuff, although it's nice to see the DCEU not revel in the dark n' gritty stuff for a change. And they made good on the storyline they had, even if it was something we'd seen before. Being honest this felt like an episode of a larger show rather than a movie. Again, not to say I hate this movie, I love it and it's such a beam of light in this grim year",4
100819,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Why are people hating on this so much? As far as film sequels go, especially superhero movies, it was a pretty decent movie. Sure there were some things that kinda didn’t like...fit with the theme I guess (like from ww2 to a guy becoming a magic rock?) but it was still pretty good. Gal and Chris’s acting along with the great visual effects saved the thing and made it watchable. Sure it wasn’t as great as the first one but it’s definitely not the monstrosity people say it is. This really deserves more like a 7.5/10 but I still recommend watching.",4
100820,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"This movie is an example of why reading reviews is a waste of time. It clearly wasn’t as good as the first in my opinion...but it built upon the first one and did a great job of illustrating (in a superhero/comic book kinda way) what the world would likely look like if the fantasy of the story were able to happen in real life. Yeah maybe there were some nit-picky changes that could’ve been made to simplify things, but I ain’t gonna whine about what coulda shoulda woulda. It was more than satisfying the way it is. I give 4 stars next to its 5 star predecessor.",4
100821,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"This WW movie is meant for die hard aficionados of this superhero - it moves straight from her childhood bringing up maxim of ""never resort to cheating however justified"" to her living a solitary life in a metropolis. Pure magic also makes an appearance in a relic of the ancient 'Gods' granting wishes no matter how complex to which everyone succumbs. What makes the movie work ultimately is just the good acting displayed by all the three main actors (not counting her 'pilot' ex partner). In particular, the central character who ends up looking good even when in distress or crying. Also, a noteworthy thing is that not even the villains are totally bad - there is some hope still left for this current human civilization yet.",3
100822,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Husband review: kept the family’s attention for 2 hours; however, the plot was was goofy that one person whom embraces a colorful rock then becomes the rock granting wishes. Of course, there’s a trade off, the rock now a person, receives what they want from the other person In return. Now this is my opinion and mine only that with all those bright people in Hollywood that someone could have created a plot and story line that made some realistic sense. The first Wonder Woman movie, l purchased because l really enjoyed and would watch again. This sequel, wait until it can be rented for a dollar and enjoy the popcorn lol.",3
100823,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"The movie fell short in some areas and failed to recapture on what made the previous film memorable in the first place. But it made up for it by depicting a different form of conflict that requires little need for violence. At least the movie was successfully able to convey its message in an emotional way. In the end ""Wonder Woman 1984"" may not be that great but it definitely left a smile on my face. This movie is still a worthy sequel that DC fans will still enjoy though they may be disappointed with key character changes that deviated from the original comic incarnation and background origins. But it's for the best of the story which was done with careful thought and consideration.",3
100824,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Not bad for a sequel. The story is one that's been told time and time again in various iterations but, intertwined with the virtue and morality of the Amazons, it works. Gal Gadot once again shines as Diana Prince giving a passionate performance that is captivating. A balance of strength, grace, and immeasurable gentleness, Diana must find a way to defeat Maxwell Lord: a burgeoning threat to the world. She must also face Barbara Minerva who proves to be a formidable opponent. Diana must contend with all this while also re-discovering love with Steve Trevor. The story feels well paced, clever in some spots and maybe a little corny but overall entertaining.",3
100825,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I didn't really like the first wonder woman but I heard that this movie is much better, so I was really pumped. I haven't really enjoyed much of the DCEU movies, the only good ones are Shazam and Aquaman the rest were not that great in my opinion but I was hoping that this movie would be one of the better ones. And for the most part, it was, The action scenes are very limited but they are all pretty decent and the special effects were good and all the characters are great and they all have decent motivations. Surprisingly the comedy was actually one of the best parts and I laughed numerous times. However, the movie was way too long and convoluted and I could barely see what was going on in the final battle. The movie was also really boring sometimes. The scenes with wonder woman and max lord were all entertaining but I didn't find any of the scenes with Cheetah very interesting. Overall the movie was a good time and a step up from the original but a little bit underwhelming. 7/10",3
100826,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Interesting perspective, nothing ‘80’s really featured other than cars. Didn’t capture the essence of the ‘80’s. Cheetah could’ve been so much more. WW had some growth and loved the uses of the lasso and the mortality she contends with. Nowhere near the level of excellence of the original but you can see her character grow to understand how she could defeat big bads like Doomsday in batman v super. I think they could’ve done a way better plot with more villainy as well as saving humanity, but we’re all battling things even now, so its nice to see through this film, an introspective on ourselves. Was lacking though in many areas.",3
100827,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Mixed filling. Not at all pleased. Wonder woman 1 was superb good plot, storyline and superb delivery 10/10. This one ill have to say no,  storyline not good ,  delivery not good at all. Chris knew how to fly new version jet and doesnt know what a trash can is, not buying the idea.All in all the valuable lesson is to be happy you have to be satisfied with what you have. The movie also ends in a cliche,  the movie ends with everyone being happy  smiling and cheerful . There's nothing wrong with that,  its a holiday season lets keep smiling. Life is not always rainbows and that steals away the titanic ending of the movie . For more understanding watch PYAR KA PUNCHNAMA 1 and compare it to 2.",3
100828,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Gal Gadot delivers an emotional side of Wonder Woman, a bit different from the first one, where we saw her warrior side. Patty Jenkins did not deliver her message that she wants to share properly this time, but she did her best. Villains are all over the place, literally and figuratively. Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) brings all the emotion and wonder in this film, brilliant acting as always. Overall the film is not that cohesive and proper, but there are some elements that are worthwhile. You could give the movie a shot, but don't expect a lot, especially with the action sequences, which really made a lot of audiences wanting more and not having enough. That's my take on Wonder Woman 1984.",3
100829,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Just like most fans, we at Toga Times were very excited for this film. It was the sequel to one of the best DCEU movies ever, Wonder Woman. However, instead we were given a really okay and decent movie. The premise and story of the film was kinda boring, and the comic book its based on is boring, so...it's not entirely their fault. However, they could have chosen to pick another Wonder Woman story to make a movie of it. The film had a lot of dialogue more than talking and the whole ""greedy"" concept is overused in movies today. Gal Gadot does a great job as usual, but the story kinda set the movie off. WW 84 is overall an okay film, but definetly not one to watch during quarantine.",3
100830,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"As one of the only superhero movies of the year I was hoping for something special. To be positive about it, pre teens and particularly young girls should have a blast. Anyone wanting good or tight storytelling, acting and not to just go whaaaa? and laugh at its incredulous moments maybe better not bothering, as the fantastical wish fulfilment was uses as heavily int he script development as the script itself. And no mention of the biggest cultural event of the 84, prince/purple rain was a minor oversight that will bug the purple army. Hope that’s not too spoilery or specific. It’s big and bright and I’m glad I caught it (not the best terminology maybe) in a cinema.",3
100831,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"What a massive disappointment. Went in with high hopes after that awesome trailer with the Blue Monday soundtrack and I like Gal Gadot. It started well but went downhill very quickly. Where was the fun and cool nostalgic references to the 1980's? There was so many opportunities to include great music and action etc. that were completely missed. Kristin Wiig was OK.. not great - relationship with WW not fully developed and she was obviously sticking with her usual schtick which is getting very tired. Villian (?) was awful and most of all boring... he needs to spend some serious time studying Michael Douglas' speech in Wall Street if that is what he was going for. I can think of any number of actors who could do a better job than that. His lack of ""villany"" meant as an audience you basically just didn't care what happened. I don't know how this got through pre-screenings in its current state. My view - more fun, more action, one (good) villan to focus the plot on!",2
100832,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,DC comics was doing super good like shazam and aquaman were both really good. But this movie fails its first movie. There are four main problems I have with this movie. The first is its terrible stunts like the mall scene was absolutely abysmal. The second is the plot now there isnt any big issues first the main villian is pretty interesting and I wish they could have expanded his relationship with his son because it doesn't feel like they did much. The next thing about the plot is about someone who isnt really that intresting I mean her story is weird and it just feels so unnatural and then when she asks to be a perfect being she becomes a furry which is really weird. Third is the message now spoilers ok so wonderwoman's final line was like you can have what you want all the time which was really confusing I have no clue what the message was. Also the gold dress she has in the trailer has nothing to do with the plot at all and she apparently can fly anyway there are really stupid plot points and the only good action scene is the first one with young diana. Anyway not that great ill give  plot 2/10 characters 4/10 action 4/10 and overall a 3/10 not great pretty disappointing for all the hype,2
100833,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"A list of complants for WB:a meh to overhyped not much action, weird cam angles, felt rushed yet slow, felt steve was only there for fan service and maxell lord went from failed bussuiness man, to a guy with power expanding the oil industry, to a guy who's sick and needs wishes for some reason. And felt that cheeta was not only rushed but not given much in the plot. The plot of the stone and wonderwoman's job felt conventant, because she stopped said robbery where it was discovered. cheeta never questions how she is doing any of this and goes along with the plot until she needs to betray diana. i don't know how maxwell could hear anything she was saying.the nerf was put there to build tension but i didn't feel it cause one we know she is alive, two this is a female empowerment movie so the main girl charater isn't going to die.we never catch up with cheeta after she renouces her wish.To much showing not enough telling. i feel like i missed a chunk of the moive. Maxwell loving his son came out of know where cause in the begining he is shown lying to his son and is a butt towards him for the rest of the movie.the fight with cheeta was short cause she was devloped. To hate diana know one for all these movies metions the disaster or brought up. the armor in the movie served no purpose cause she could have thrown cheeta away anywhere. cheeta was nerfed in the final battle for no reason. everything worth seeing was in the trailer. the slow motion shots were bad. Got overly campy. campy mixed with drama can't work all the time. pretty sure the armor was for looks. barbra has one scene of friendship with diana. there were no reprecctions. it felt like this movie would be better if it had nothing to do with the DCEU. the moives lesson for diana is lying is bad and all of that death just for that lesson. after all that happened people would know who diana is",2
100834,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I was really excited for this movie to come out. Man, what a disappointment. The first Wonder Woman that came out a few years ago, I remember feeling like it was one of the best big blockbuster movies I had seen in a long time. Wonder Woman 1984 is one of the worst big blockbuster movies I have seen. The special effects are so terrible, the villain, Max Lord is poorly acted, Kristin Wig kills it in the beginning but underwhelms and isn’t convincing once she transforms into the movie’s second villain. Gal Gardot is stunning and charming, much less than the first WW, but when she has to convey heartbreak towards the end, that was some terrible acting. The CGI is obvious and terrible, and the Costume “shield of armor” getup was bad....like a head-to-toe gold foil bad Halloween costume. I would love to see another WW if they are able to recreate some of the magic of the first WW, the 80’s was already a kinda cheeseball era and this movie definitely is on par with that and it just doesn’t leave you with a great superhero movie.",2
100835,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"An hour snd a half in the story still hadn’t captured me. Loved the first movie and loved the 80’s fashion in this one but the movie as a whole is a miss for me. Your mileage may vary. At one point Wonder Woman is running 55 mph pushing a 6x6 medium military transport down a highway sideways... 45 seconds later she can’t keep one smaller truck swerving into another from crushing her.  A rocket propelled grenade containing maybe 8 oz of propellant was lassoed and carried a 140 lb lady down range a couple of hundred yards at what looked like 100 mph. If we can get Elon whatever fuel was in that RPG he can get us the Mars easily. All comic movies are full of weird things like this, I suppose these stood out because I wasn’t enjoying the movie as a whole.",2
100836,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"First let me say I think Gal Gadot is the perfect casting for Diana Prince/ Wonder Woman. And the first Wonder Woman film was pretty incredible, still a film that I go back to rewatch, and enjoy as if it’s my first time seeing it. But this second installment of the franchise was a huge let down. The plot was a disaster, so many plot holes in the story. As well as poor decision making for the writers such as allowing rape, and the solution to fixing the main problem of the story. This review should not reflect on Gal Gadot as her portrayal of the character is spot on to the best of her ability giving the poor writing. The movie was lackluster lacking any truly exciting moments, I found myself checking my phone throughout the whole movie which is something I rarely do whenever I’m watching a movie with a favorable character for the first time. I have to say my favorite part of the film was her flying scene for the gorgeous visuals. I truly hope the next Wonder Woman film will leave a better taste in my mouth. I was really excited for this film and even kept tabs on it before it officially came out and the best way to describe it is a disappointment. But please still watch the film for yourself as you might feel differently about it than I do.",2
100837,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Wonder Woman 1984 definitely wasn’t as good as the first. The movie started off good with some Amazonian Olympics and small time crooks robbing a mall and Princess Diana saving the day without much difficulty. But after this there wasn’t much action, a lot of dialogue, and just very boring to sit through. I really only feel like there were only 3 to 4 action sequences that didn’t last more than 5 minutes. Cheetah was ok, not great, just ok. My only real positives was the humor of Chris Pines acting discovering new things in the year 1984, and Pedro Pascals performance as Max Lord. Other than that, very boring, dull, and long without much action to keep me hooked. Probably will watch maybe 2 more times, if that, just to see if I can find something rave about. What a let down from the first film, which was a 6 out of 5 stars in my book.",2
100838,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Poorly paced, too long and a really odd story but with a couple good, emotional moments. Gal Gadot does fine with what she has to work with and Chis Pine is delightful, but Barbara Minerva and Maxwell Lord are just bad, confusing villains. They obviously didn't spend any of the extra time from the original release date to polish the special effects, which stand out in a bad way. I don't know how, but a couple movies with a dozen more characters to juggle, Infinity War/Endgame, felt much less muddled than this. I got bored about an hour in and at 1:40 I checked how much time was left and was exasperated to see 50 minutes still left. If you make it to the end, the credits scene is sort of fulfilling for older viewers, if kinda blah in content. Maybe just skip the movie and watch the credits scene? If you have HBO Max, give it a try, you may as well. I loved the first one and this was pretty disappointing.",2
100839,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I’ll keep this short. First let me say that the first Wonder Woman was brilliant, well written, and honored the former writers and story everyone came to love! That said, It should be commonly understood now that the farther the writers and producers move away from the original story (comic book ethos) the worse the interest, ratings, profits will become. It doesn’t matter if it’s WW, Green Latern, or even a freaking Jedi Knight...look at the mucked up Star Wars story that had to be salvaged by a bounty hunter and Baby Yoda! Like Disney, DC is headed the same direction with a story less interested in plot and character development and more interested in interjecting political jabs. I mean really, a woke WW in the mid 80s? Bad idea there DC and not surprisingly a bad movie as well! Case in point...This film was shallow in the telling and acting. In fact, this movie is so bad that Chris Pine, Gal Gadot, nor a freaking Jedi Knight (if they had somehow had written one in) could save it. When you wonder why the sequel to Wonder Woman suffers in the ratings and profits, go back to the first movie and comic books and remember what makes this story so appealing...it’s not this train wreck. Still, this movie was a fitting end to 2020!",2
100840,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Why are so many poeple saying 5 star?? It was awful, such a disappointment, I am a writer/director too (not big movies but adverts) And I couldn’t understand anything which was happening, I get the basic story line hence why it’s not a 1 star but very close, I would put it at 1 1/2. And you could never tell it was the same director as the last movie yet it is I think, the whole movie is just so different to the first one (which was very good, 4 1/2 stars) in terms of story telling and just style of movie. I see what the director was going for but was probs high or something because they didn’t make anything make sense, like why does the bad guy want to get everyone’s wishes, why does the girl who made that wish want to become a cat and also how did she become a cat??? Like everyone gets one wish??? But come on DC, you disappointed me and I loved the last movies (Shazam and Wonder Woman) apart from justice league, it was an ok movie I just didn’t like it like when you have nice food but you didn’t like it. But this???? Come on. I hope DC make a good sequel to Shazam cos marvel is millions of miles ahead of DC",2
100841,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"For a movie billed as a flagship feature film this was just unbelievably bad.  The timing was also poor luck as Pascal (villain) has just finished his run as the Mandalorian, in what can only be described as the most favorably received touch on Star Wars lore in memory.  Wiig’s affable character oozed what makes her a fun loving character - but the cross over into whatever that last 30 minute spectacle conclusion was kept this at silly, over the top, laughing at than concerned for.  Finally the protagonist Godot, spent most of her characters pivotal scenes, on the floor beaten down or pinned against a wall, defeated but philosophical.  Her lasso was pure CGI mayhem that reflected the physics more of a noodle, and tie those two things together, and our hero is leaning more on “luck” which ultimately reduces her superhero-ness into pedestrian and the ultimate face-palm.  Wonder woman is no Superman, but it should have been a more dominant finish.  Underwhelmed.",1
100842,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Wonder Woman 1984 review: This film is a heavy handed period piece serving as an allegory for American decadence. The pacing left one of the most anticipated action movies of the year dragging. Kristen Wiig was great as Cheetah. She had a compelling story arch that ended on a lackluster note. I wished they had done more with her character. The reimagining of Maxwell Lords was the worst part of the movie. He was a terrible character to build a plot around. The action was great, especially the opening race scene of a young Diana. The fashion was 80's chic, but the story was so 2020. Wonder Woman essentially fought Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and quite frankly, us. I've been watching this battle for the last 4 years and I wasn't interested in seeing it show up in my super hero movie. Look, Patty Jenkins who directed both films, but only wrote the script for the sequel, delivered a garbage script. But I do appreciate Jenkins consistency in taking DC's best super hero movie, outside Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and making it as awful as the rest of the Justice League films.",1
100843,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"Idk what movie these 5 star reviewers watched, but I found this to be an incredibly corny installment.  This film really leans on people getting thrown around rooms which makes fall damage the real antagonist.  The incidents where she helps civilians made me cringe. At one point, I could've sworn I saw Diana return a lollipop to a baby in a stroller after it was taken momentarily by a hardened criminal.  The trailer made it seem like the movie was going to be a blast of neon infused action throughout.  In addition, I cannot take Kristin Wiig seriously in a superhero movie.  Of course you can be a comedian and do serious roles, but she delivers every line like it was an SNL live skit.  Her ""transformation"" into Cheetah was so dumb and confusing, that im assuming the majority of people questioned, ""why did she turn into a cheetah?""  The amount of CGI assitance the characters need during fight scenes takes you completely out of the experience.  It seems like destruction and big events during battles were just hatched up on the writing bored so something exciting happened in the background.     The dialog is too weak as well.  It is kind of tiring watching DC make a character look in shock at their new found powers and wasting time, or showing Chris Pine look in awe at all the modern day inventions and mistake a trash can for a piece of art.   The film was 1-hour too long.  Again, who thought this was a 5-star movie? I have to imagine these aren't serious movie-goers.",1
100844,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,I know 2020 it’s been a bad year but if you really need this movie to reflect and “escape” reality dam.... you have horrible movie 🎥  taste 👅... I haven’t watched the first movie and was looking forward to this and again i was disappointed by 2020 😭. There were so many cringing moments like really lassoing the lighting? Learning to fly only because her boyfriend told her a little speech?? Her boyfriend has to walk her threw everything and be there fighting for her and he is the only “good guy” in the movie?? How did she get her golden armor while flying?! Was she carrying it on her invisible purse 👛?? The flying scenes look like from the 2000s  flying with her arms open like if peter pan came to her window @ night.... i mean come on the last final battle is not even a fighting scene she talks the villain out of his Main goal. He fought for all that just to get talked out of it without a fight.... talk about following your dreams and wishes... and what cat lady scene why would you wish to be more of an animal than we already are??? Its just a bunch of things put together and some nice visual effect with big money behind it thats all nothing special and will probably be forgotten like this year....,1
100845,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"One of if not the worst superhero flicks ever, wish I could have given it a ZERO. For one,  It's totally present-day Hollywood WOKE. The director portrays men as sex-crazed money-hungry animals and women are all subservient victims. What 80's parallel universe did this director live in? The plot is totally ridiculous, the acting is worse than poor, more like Z grade Amateure i.e straight to DVD. The special effects are lame to say the least, There are so many holes in this plot we lost count. Not only can Steve be resurrected from the dead inhabiting some poor guy's body, but he can also fly a 1980's fighter jet? He died in WWI, He must have taken flying lessons in the afterlife.  Kids playing ball in the street as a convoy of bad guys careens towards them? An old Peugeot takes hundreds of bullets but the windshield doesn't get hit once, and they leave the poor guy in the middle of the desert? Cheetah sure does a job on WW's invincible armor. Obviously, in this universe, Superman, Batman, and all the rest of the DC Sups don't exist. Which is probably a good thing. as to not tarnish their franchises.  There are NO redeeming qualities to this mess. Glad it was free on HBO Max, would have demanded our money back if we paid in a theatre.",1
100846,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"In a movie where people fly and turn into magic cats the most unbelievable thing was that Wonder Woman has spent the last seventy years without a social life pining for a mediocre man. The movie gestures towards all kinds of social issues—racism and immigration, US imperialism, misogyny, and women's empowerment—but it doesn't do justice to any of these themes or follow through with them. Pedro Pascal is a pleasure to watch, wresting a complex character from a very poor screenplay, but none of the other actors have enough to work with to really know what to think about their skill as performers. Wonder Woman's relationship with Barbara isn't developed enough for the falling out between them to have any weight or really make much sense, but Chris Pine is better in this film than the previous one because his character has the self awareness to realize that he's not worth the heartache that his superhero lover feels for him.",1
100847,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,First things first there have been alot of 5 star reviews by people who haven't even seen the movie.We've all seen great movie trailers that end up being terrible movies and this is a case in point. Really enjoyed the first film not perfect by any means but it had heart a reasonable plot good effects and a gorgeous lead in Mrs Gadot. I would echo any 1star review of the sequel. I went to see this with my wife and if it wasn't for the fact that it costs slot of money to go to the cinema these days we would both have walked out after half an hour. Truly truly awful in every way (Gals still gorgeous though),1
100848,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"WW1984: DCEU has a knack of casting good actors and making them into goofy and lamest villains. This franchise is beyond saving! With that being said, Patty Jenkins has sprinkled feminism throughout that didn't bother much compared to the third act which was so bad that ""I wished"" the movie was over after the watchable first half, let alone the cringiest climax of the decade! Gal Gadot is still trying her best to show that she too can act... What a better way to finish the movie with a forced Christmas themed ending. 👏🏾 XD",1
100849,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"I cannot believe how terrible this movie is, although I should have seen this coming when it was announced that Geoff Johns is writing the story, I know both Patty and Geoff are credited but after watching Monster (2003) in comparison to DCs Titans, reading Doomsday Clock and hearing Johns explain the 'Martha Scene' in BvS, it is crystal clear that ONLY Johns wrote the absolutely moronic story of Wonder Woman 1984. There are so many non-sensical, self-contradictory plot points that even my mother and sister lost interest after 30 mins. One plot point being the Amazon Olympics at the beginning which COMPLETELY self contradicts the first film where Diana had to secretly (key word SECRETLY) train with Antiope until she is a teenager because Hippolyta had forbidden it when Diana was a 7 year old. It also contradicts the plot point where Diana has no idea that she is a Demi-God until she fights Ares, so how would she know at the age of 11 during the Amazon Olympics when she almost wins. This movie sucks just like Aquaman because of Geoff John's pathetic writing and the fact that WB continues to hire this guy to write more stories is very concerning.",1
100850,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,Action/Fantasy,"As far as lack luster, run it back sequels go WW84 is all that and more disappointment. Heavy set narration to tell plot points/story that should be shown and developed. A return to Themyscira, for no reason, padding to a run time that could have been used to better develop character arcs. Wonder Woman gives away her power to be with a man (amazing image for young girls to look up to.) A hokey and very outdated use of a makeover montage that adds nothing to the story (a lazy copy done by Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman.) An ending monologue that was a horrendous attempt at a heartfelt message, which basically breaks the fourth wall. Two prominent villains from the comics that had no development (aside from a throw in clip montage of Max Lord last minute.) In short, a standard Warner Bros Studio comic book movie.",1
100851,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"This was a well thought out movie that captures the imagination, tears at the heart and puts morals into question. Is Jim's character weak or is it just a combination of chances with human nature for companionship wanting in  a desperate moment. What would you do? I myself maybe would have went longer before collapsing into a metal breakdown I think but since I have never been subjected to such things I can only imagine what he went through. In the end it worked out but it was luck of the draw it seems. I felt for the characters and understood their pains and dilemma's and this is the hallmark of a great story that puts you in their place. This is a must watch movie. I do not understand the hateful critics of this movie. But I digress, critics are unhappy people without a life and try to keep their jobs with some upturned nose review of a life they will never achieve. How they keep their jobs is beyond my understanding with the drivel they spout.",5

100856,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,The critics should F themselves. They think they know everything about movies and rate the movies based on their so called intelligence (which of course they don't have any). This movie is really great and focuses on feeling of loneliness and meaning of life and not entirely on space travel. A MUST WATCH. Acting is good. Casting seems perfect. Ending could have been a bit more elaborate. But this ending also works well for me.,5

I came into this movie  with zero expectations but after sitting through it, I can boldly attest that this is, if not the best, one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever come across. Everything from character development to dialogue is absolutely on point, something most sci-fi movies lack. I really enjoyed every minute of it.",5
100858,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,this movie is hot hot hot. That butt scene with chrissy pratty's big bussy was soooo good. Such a big peach on that man.

100860,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"I see lots of negative reviews, but to me they miss the point of the movie. The vacant, empty, ""alone"" feeling is what the whole experience is about. Not every movie needs car crashes, transforming robots and impossible fight scenes. If you like sci fi and don't need to wrack your brain - or you just want a good story with some eye candy for you and your spouse, give this one a try. My wife and I re-watch it once a year on a date night.",5
100861,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"It’s not a bad film.  The critics pan it as awful mainly because Chris Pratt isn’t a an openly radical leftist and that’s all anyone is allowed to be anymore. I read the bad critics reviews and they are so unsubstantiated and lame for the low ratings given.  Granted it’s not genius work. And Lawrence, though very pretty, is a tedious actress in my opinion.  But it’s thoughtful and entertaining far more than much of the boring story-less preaching  tripe praised to the sky by these “critics”.  Who aside from radical wokesters and the cancel mob even reads these critic reviews anymore?",4
100862,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Disagree entirely with the news paper critics .IMO this film has a good deal realism which is refreshing in this era of over blown action movies. I found the relationship between the two main characters quite beleivable  considering how they first met and where it ended. The comparison with the film Gravity I dont really see, Gravity was  breathtaking in parts but the story was to me quite ridiculous. If you like space fiction a little slower and more realistic then you will like it.If however you want loads of action and masses of cgi and explosions then no this is not for you .",4

100864,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"I delayed this movie on my watching list because of all the bad critics about it. I finally watched it on Netflix and I was very surprised by it. Obviously, this is not a space opera, this is a romantic movie happening in a very peculiar setting. And there are indeed flat moments.

We had to experience the same tedium as them on the ship to feel it. Despite the lack of action there was still a palpable tension throughout. Lawrence's reaction to being told she was woken up by Jim was also spot on. I've watched a string of poor movies recently and this one was a breath of fresh air. Critics - get out of your own arses.",4
100866,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"A movie you will fall in love with. The visuals of the movies have their own story, this for me is one of the best love stories.

100870,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Truly unique premise, solid performances. Things turn murky when a 4th character (mostly this is a 3-character story) shows up briefly, but besides that stumble, Passengers poses questions deeper minds will ponder after the credits roll.

100871,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Unique movie, definitely worth a watch.  The most impressive aspect is the stunning visual effects, looked so real. Story is thought provoking and several ethical issues to be explored. Questions about destiny and if everything happens for a reason is one of the subtle but crucial underlying theme. Not sure why the movie received bad criticism and is actually under-rated. Probably the plot can be slightly improved but overall I recommend it. Great acting by Chris Pratt.",3
100872,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"I'll try to keep my thoughts brief - I enjoyed this movie. Not thoroughly, but enough to say I'd watch it again. I love the way it allows us to ask ourselves what we'd do in the given situation. How far would our humanity go? Would we wake someone else up, die of old age alone, or just off ourselves? The plot is redeeming in the sense that Pratt is given a chance to restore his mistake in offering Lawrence a chance to sleep again; all of this of course following the rescuing of the vessell, requiring her to of been awake in the first place. As complex and impressive as the cinematics were, the story of itself is a simple one. What would you do? Wake up someone? Would you go back to sleep if given the chance?",3
100873,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Passengers is not a horrible movie. I felt that the second half of the film certainly lets the first down. Spoilers ahead but the action section at the end felt like a very forced and tacked on addition. The best part of the film is the dynamic between Jim, Aurora and Arthur.

If they had the premise of the film centred entirely around the characters and no silly save themselves plot it would be much better.",3

100881,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"...and the award for the most disappointing film of 2016 goes to Passengers! I can't tell you how long I waited for this movie to come out, it was at the top of my must see list for months, and I was more excited to see this than almost any other film this year. For those unfamiliar with the story, five thousand passengers are in suspended animation for one hundred and twenty years, as they prepare to start a new life on a brand new planet. Thirty years into the journey, there is a malfunction and two of the sleeping pods open, awakening two of the passengers ninety years early. Everything I read and saw made this look like THE film to see this year, but the truth is it was beyond boring. This malfunction that awoke them, was part of a cascade failure, meaning small failure got worse over time, years in fact, and nothing serious actually happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. Until then, it's a lot of talking, romance, sadness about how they'll waste their lives alone on this ship for nothing. This had to be why the studio paid two of the best young actors in Hollywood a ton of money to be in this thing, because they knew no matter how boring the story or bad the reviews got, people would still go to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Congratulations Columbia Pictures, it worked, you made your money on this one and yes the special effect were cool, but how many people were actually entertained by this film? I for one was not, this film come in at just under two hours long and I felt like I was sitting in the theater for a week, that right there says it all.",2
100882,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"This is probably a good love story but it really sucks as a sci fi movie. The writing, dialog and acting are all good. But all the sci fi premises are really weak. Essentially, I learned by watching this movie that it's probably not possible to do either genre justice in one 2 hour film. Actually, they made a solid love story, as cheesy as all of those are. But in order to do that, we're given an extremely hollow and shallow sci fi film. It's a mall in space, including classism. Chris Pratt is supposed to be an engineer and he's shrugging off a couple years worth of cascading system failures because he's lonely. The ship falling apart is hardly paid attention to until Laurence Fishburn wakes up. So many scientific and engineering faux pas have to be written in so we can make the script work. It's no good, you catch it and spend 3/4 of the movie shaking your head. The writing barely keeps it afloat, but the ship and it's design idiocies start undoing your entertainment from the get go. ""They wouldn't have overlooked that. They would have designed a contingency for that. Crew would have been woken up if automated repair failed. Crew would have been woken up if a hibernation chamber failed like that."" There are a million thoughts like that. Maybe this movie kinda flopped for that reason. It doesn't work at all as a sci fi film and I don't know what love story fanatics would see in it either.",2

100891,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Imagine the worst episode of Star Trek, without its crew. Introduce a man who can fix anything (computers, nuclear reactors, hibernation pods); he also is a barber, a sculptor and a gardener. Let him fall in love with a locked-up woman. Drown the movie script with a bucket of false romance ... now you have Passengers.",1
100892,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"I thought the last-man-and-woman-alive trope was a thing of the past. He picks his girl, who can only pick him. For a short and promising while she rebels against his actions once she finds out he created the situation willingly. But soon, during the grand finale, she succumbs to the trope's inevitable conclusion. She wants him, she needs him, she can't live without him, he is her universe (because he is the only other human alive).",1
100893,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,It’s pretty horrifying. Chris Pratt basically slow murders Jennifer Lawrence and we are misled into thinking it’s a consensual romance. It’s a dark movie about a man controlling a woman and convincing her that she likes it. Let me repeat: this is essentially a motion picture rape and murder.,1
100894,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"chris evans and hailey atwel were great in this, but the supporting cast seemed pretty distracted most of the time and almost asleep. the visual effects remind me of something a film student would create. 1 star",1
100895,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,THE ENDING WAS HORRIFIC this the most disappointing ending I have ever seen but the rest is ok just wish there was a better ending cause it just seems so brief and we dont get to see the said planet and it just ruins what everyone was expecting and ends abruptly,1
100896,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"First thing before watching this movie I've completed HUNGER GAMES, and i don't want to see Jennifer Lawrence KATNISS with someone other than PEETA, so this movie made me feel wierd when she was with chris patt.",1
100897,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,He should’ve died it would’ve made it realistic and the fact he didn’t die ruined the whole movie for me. It only gets one star because she’s hot.,1
100898,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,Ouch ..  this industry pays 100 million to turn out trash like this .. what we could do with this money is eye watering ... Do not watch it is not worth your time,1
100899,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,Made me physically angry to watch. Poor writing poor directing and the only female is a prop not a character.,1
100900,Passengers,2016,Sci-fi/Romance,"Problematic, the film shows that no matter how terrible an act a man can act towards a woman, she will still fall in love with him.",1
100901,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"Only once in a decade are movies of such class made. This one stands out for its sheer brilliance in acting, direction. You'll love the story as well..........However, if you're looking a scary movie, then please stay away....this is not for a fan of low grade nonsense picturisation. This movie will make you take sips of ecstacy, alchol and emotions. A bottle of cognac would even increase he pleasure of watching it........Its just such fabulous movie!",5
100902,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,really good movie according to me as it is full of thrill and the best part about it is that nobody even suspects Tom like when I was watching i thought of anna cause of making Rachel the most sus one then of Max cause of killing his baby!! This movie is freaking amazing I loved it like broooo awesome!?!?,5
100903,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"Very good story and acting. You really have to pay attention as it moves around a lot. Very good, I always liked a movie where you never know how it ends up. Quite the twist at the end.",5
100904,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"A cinematic presentation worth spending your precious seconds and minutes on! Must see one. It's deep, dark and nerve wrecking. Inspire the art of manifestation of a mental breakdown through spectrum of emotions conveyed through each character.",5
100905,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I have read the book. And I loved how it ended, Tom getting his due punishment - the death that he offered to Megan and her innocent child. Also the fact that Rachel started to practice of being sober again. Another thing was evident that she hadn't made further ties with the Hipwell's.",5
100906,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,Loved this movie. Pari has done awesome job and Kriti Kulhari too. I have read the book already when it was released. Book is very very engaging and so was the movie.,5
100907,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,At first I thought it was some kind of boring movie but I actually finished the whole movie with complete interest. I was really full of suspense and beautiful in its own way.,5
100908,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,What I love about this movie is that it did things I've imagined when I was reading the book. I love it! You should check this movie out.,5
100909,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I loved the plot, the acting and everything about this film. Parineeti Chopra has done a full justice to this role and she emerges out as a winner.",5
100910,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"Engrossing portrait of a tortured soul, contemporary and yet a throw back to Gaslight. Typical bad guy male is softened by semi-supportive husband. Loved the novel and the film.",5
100911,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I really liked the film. Emily Blunt is very convincing in her role. The film shows how our perception of our own lives and the lives of others can be false. The character played by Emily Blunt, thought that the life of the murdered girl was so perfect, little by little she realised that her life was very far from a dream.  On the other hand she thought that she was a total wreck because of her alcoholism and she was the reason why her husband lost his job. She recalled afterwards that in fact her husband invented all that .",4
100912,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,The movie is amazing. And each character fits perfectly in their roles. Meera kaboor (pariniti chopra) is the lead of the movie.the actress has really made everybody believe in her acting skills..she has done a commendable job.i am obsessed with the movie ❤️,4
100913,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I was completely fooled by what this film was really about with some stellar performances from all the actors, especially Emily Blunt and Justin Theroux. I must say that Rebecca Ferguson continues to impress with a role in stark contrast to previous films, like Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise; Men in Black International, with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson and even more so in the first film I ever saw her in as the menacing and haunting ""Rose the Hat"" in Doctor Sleep.",4
100914,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"A puzzle with random pieces. Not a happy movie but a cinematic challenge. I never thought the pieces would mesh together, but in the final moments, cohesion was accomplished. Competent directing. If you like surprise endings, you’ll enjoy this movie. As the goat among the reels in the movie lot refuse pile said, I liked the book better.",4
100915,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"a bit slow and melodramatic in the first part, but leading actress Blunt holds it together long enough for you to enjoy the second, more interesting and unpredictable part. All the rest of the cast is great, too, and music by Danny Elfman is always a positive certainty.",4
100916,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"After watching indian remake of this movie acted by parineeti.. i felt how superior emily blunt was.. really a very very good actung by her. She potrayed her character with such a honesty.. you can really feel her.. parineeti was worse, weired and funny🤣🤣🤣",4
100917,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"Don't be put off by what can appear to be a bit of a slow starting film. Glad we continued watching, good storyline with good twists. Worth the watch, hence 4 stars! :)",4
100918,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I wasn't expecting the plot twist, I thought it was going to be one of those dark endings where she really was a drunk who blacked out, she is the psycho who murders someone etc. But this is a really moving depiction of Narcissistic Abuse; the extreme/sociopathic type of narcissistic personality disorder. Worth a watch or at least treat as a psychology lesson into extreme narcissism and how they treat their victims.",4
100919,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,Emily Blunt does an excellent job portraying a woman in pain... fighting jealousy and her own internal demons. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end! A+,4
100920,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,I m quite impressed by this thriller movie. And for the critics look at the other bollywood content.this is much better then so called kjo's movies haha,4
100921,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"It was hard to watch. I finished the book and loved it and was so excited to watch the movie but it was all over the place. The movie seemed to make no sense and I wanted to turn it off so bad. Great cast, good plot to work with, but the director seemed to lack to ability to tell the story well. Giving it 3 stars though because I am doing a lot of comparing to the book.",3
100922,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,It keeps us engrossed throughout with several twists and turns leading to a thrilling suspenseful climax. Parineeti could have put in more efforts as it was a heroin centered movie.,3
100923,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,I watched the movie after reading the book. No doubt print version is good. The lady in the role of Rachael has done wonderful performance but still something lacking.,3
100924,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,A murder mystery movie over all plot is not that good as movie tends to be cheesy potraying men and his dark sexual desires and its effect on womens. Once watchable ,3
100925,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"The starting felt boring couldn't connect to the film but the climax of the scene was good with interesting twist. Pareeniti's acting was amazing, one of her best performances.",3
100926,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"When i first came to know about this movie and came to know that it is based on a novel i was highly expected with this but i must say i didn't enjoy it, suspense of the film is its plus point, you just cant imagine that it will going to happen and emily's acting is just amazing, but rest of the film is dissapointing.",3
100927,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,Very disappointed while see the movie.. worst acting except Rachel. The reveal  has given shock more when reading through book not the movie.,3
100928,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,lol you know its better then the 2021 remake because it has one more star lmao it has 3 stars so ya know its better then the 2 star remake,3
100929,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,The story was good but parineeti acting appeared forced overall an average film,3
100930,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,A slow paced but interesting movie.A watchable mystery thriller.,3
100931,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,I am not much of a review writing person but I was highly disappointed by the way this movie presents this wonderful story. It is usual to expect less from a movie as compared to book but at least the makers should have put some efforts in character development and story building throughout the movie. It seems as if some random shots were filmed and put together without context in the movie as I feel how many crucial details were missed that actually made the story so thrilling. Dialogues seemed unrelatable to sciences that had been shown in movie bcoz they are directly picked up from the book and pasted here without any context that rob them of the essence. It's only the last 15 min of the film thats been shown accurately and impressively but it's doesn't do any good if rest of the plot confuses the audience. Only the character of Rachel seems apt and rest of the characters appear like a showpiece ..they did so bad with male characters though they had an important role in the story. This plot could have been presented in a much better way but unfortunately this one isn't appreciable 😟,2
100932,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"This is a terrible movie. They attempt to narrate it through direct speech, the accents are all completely different so it is unclear where it is even set and the acting itself is subpar at best. The storyline is hard to follow and had I not read the book beforehand I would have no understanding. It rushes to begin and does not stay even slightly true to the phenomenal book. This is all around bad.",2
100933,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,I read the book before watching; I had such high hopes and couldn’t wait to see the potential of the film. I was really disappointed with how much of the story they had cut out. Even some of the scenes happened in the wrong places. Not really worth seeing if you’ve read the book in my opinion.. sorry :(,2
100934,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"The Hindi version of this movie is soooo much better. It’s not a statement I ever thought I’d make! Also, although I’m a huge fan of Emily Blunt, Parineeti Chopra did a far superior job doing justice to this role.",2
100935,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I agree with Mr. Gleiberman above. This was a so so read and a so so movie. I think the motion of the train must lure people into a sleepy stupor wherein they think they enjoy the movie. I didn’t enjoy anything about the story, book or film.",2
100936,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,They casted a white venezuelan for the role of Abdic. Why???? They even had him speak some spanish during a passionate moment. The film lost all credibility for me there. Poor adaptation of the book overall.,2
100937,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"OK I guess, but just reinforces why I rarely watch films of books I've read! As usual, I spent most of the film saying ""That didn't happen in the book"", right from the first minute when it was apparent the film was not set in London. The sound-track wasn't great either, a bit muffled - perhaps that's my hearing!",2
100938,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,The Director has made most obvious mistakes while filming this classic story. Parineeta has miles to go before she can do a role which convince audience of her acting skills.,2
100939,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,Come on netflix.. you can do better. what the heck is this? this is an insult and a waste of time. Will not waste any more of my time providing reasons for this review.,2
100940,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"Bad editing had to be it , because the story cannot be this bad. And what is with the acting , everyone had just one emotion on display..",2
100941,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,This movie did nothing for me period. A waste of money to make. Let's just say it just should've stayed as a book. Some people say they were on the edge of their seats and personally my feet didn't touch the floor once. Some mentioned that this movie contained many plot twist but it was highly expected. The lack of character development made this movie even more unbearable to watch. If I need something to fall asleep on i'll make sure to turn this movie on! Thanks and goodnight. Despite don't let this review stop you from watching the movie if you choose.,1
100942,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"This movie is a mess. I don’t remember how much I paid for the DVD but I wish I could get my money back. I could tell the story had potential but the screen writing and directing put an end to that. Flash forward, flash back, flash sideways. I’m so sick of it. Tell a story so people can follow it and enjoy it or don’t tell it at all. The entire story of Megan and the shrink was annoying. I can tell the filmmakers thought they were being clever. This movie doesn’t give the viewer the opportunity to figure it out they just keep handing you bad information. That’s not clever, that’s annoying. The way the movie presents the murderer at the end felt like the director was saying “here, is this what you wanted?” Well, not everyone can make a great movie. I guess that’s why there are so few of them.",1
100943,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"The hindi version has no connection to the book. Acting is artificial . The lead actor overacts too much and does not look convincing. Putting too much mascarra does not make one look alcoholic. The lady cop tries to act tough, and with a Sikh get up is actially hilarious. In all it was only hype. The book was engrossing but this movie is a total failure. Had the makers stuck to the original storyline, it would have been more thrilling. The English version was far far way ahead and better.",1
100944,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"If you feel depressed and lonely, please don’t watch this movie because the story line is really depressing and might leave some viewers crying or thinking about their own life in depth. I personally did not like the movie as it lacked acting, also lacked a sequential chain of events where the viewer can understand the storyline, a failure in copying the original novel and a lot of grievances. I suggest you rather watch something funny then spending your precious time in deepening your thoughts towards the purpose of your life.",1
100945,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I very rarely turn a movie off mid way through, but wow...this was not good. Cinematography was very polished, but it's as if they spent all the money on cameras and editing, and none on script. The storyline was disjointed and scattered. 45 minutes in, and I was still wondering what the point was. Other than the lead actress, most everyone else was so bland and one-dimensional, it was like watching a high school production. Bad. Just bad. Maybe there was more to it in the end, but just couldn't get there.",1
100946,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"I can't express how dissappointed I was watching this movie. I read the book, and I was so excited to finally see the movie... to see how the book was brought to life. All I know is that none of the relationships were ever developed in the movie...I didn't believe the love or the hatred. It was too fake, too fast.",1
100947,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,The blurb for this film made it look promising. The blurb was wrong. The characters are dull and unlikable. The plot is slow moving and creaky. I gave up halfway though. I wasn't even interested enough to want to fast forward and find out whodunnit. One to avoid.,1
100948,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,Useless. Parineeti Chopra does not connect with the audience right from first frame. It is a very superficial experience. Tried watching it twice but gave up after trying for half an hour.,1
100949,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN I thought was completely boring and very hard to understand. Also had a lot of full nudity and definitely not for young adults. Not a good movie at all.,1
100950,The Girl on the Train,2016,Thriller/Mystery,"This film is exactly the same version of “The Girl on the Train”, an American Film in 2016 starred by Emily Blunt. I was surprised really. Did Dreamworks pictures sold this film to Bollywood?",1
100951,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Snowden is one of my favorite films in recent modern times, and it comes to no surprise to me that the average American still does not know who Edward Snowden and that for the ones who do most of them likely think of him in a negative light due to how poorly American society had treated him when he tried to bring the issue of mass domestic spying on innocent Americans to the forefront of people's minds.  Oliver Stone, who is really not controversial but does make films that the controlling establishment really do not want the general public to focus on, is one of my favorite directors in modern times, and he does not disappoint with Snowden. It should have gotten a nomination for best picture, but the Hollywood establishment and the mass media tried to downplay its importance and how entertaing the film really was.  If you have a progresive mind and consider yourself a truth seeker and like a good drama, then you will like Snowden. But there is a lot of things that the government is doing right now that the general public would not approve of if came to light, and what we need now is for young and bold directors to follow Stone's lead and put the powers that be and the corporate-controlling establishement on the defense in films.  Time is running out.  Anyway, Snowden is an entertaining and important film to watch.  The script was lively and well written, and the actors were well casted, and despite what you may here, the writing and the casting are the two most important aspects to a great film, and great directors will naturally gravitate themselves to the better film projects. I love Joseph Gordon-Levit in this film, but the entire supporting cast was highly talented and quite strong.  I particularly enjoyed Zachary Quinto's portrayal of the real-life journalist Glenn Greenwald; that performance was an example of perfect casting.  I also became an instant fan of Rhys Ifan (pronounced Reese Iffen), a highly talented Welsh actor, by his portrayal of the sinister and cunning CIA administrator. Snowden is a five star film without any question.",5
100952,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Awesome movie.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is becoming one of my favorite actors and this movie shows just how great of an actor he is.  Great movie.   While I do think the government should do its part to block and intervene when it comes to any acts that are proven to be harmful towards society, I commend Snowden on his efforts to push for individual freedom.  Awesome movie, regardless of anyone's political beliefs.  Great to see a few great actors and actresses in the movie including Nicolas Cage and the girl from Divergent.",5
100953,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"a reminder to help us never forget that our governments play us, lie to us, and seek to control us, avoiding oversight and detection if at all possible.  Edward Snowden is another idealist and whistleblower of our time.  This movie shows how he came to make this monumental act of heroism and self sacrifice.  I honour him and thank him for his gift of service to humanity.  Staggering story told immaculately.   We can count on Oliver Stone for that commitment to truth and powerful portrayal.",5
100954,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a perfect choice for Edward Snowden.  It is very scary to think that everything you do and say is on display .  I am covering my camera on my laptop today.  As a result of his actions, a lot of changes were made in congress, he did a good thing.",5
100955,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"This Movie is Rightly Recommended For I Quote ¨Anyone With a Technical Device¨ ,  This Movie is Very Good For Analysis of The CIA And The NSA, And I Thank Edward Joseph Snowden For Showing Us The Way of How We Are Being Spied On, Even if The CIA and NSA Want to Prosecute Him, He Shall Be One of The Greatest Person In America. Thank You For Edward Joseph Snowden

",5
100956,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Awesome movie. Brave Snowden. Bad government and governance. Lots of shame to go around on both sides of the “self-serving” politics of the grand USA. At my my age, just another walk in the “park”. I thought the acting was great and the actors did a fine job.",5
100957,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Thought-prokoving and cimematically imposing. Astounding movie on all scores; especially if you don't know the whole story of Snowden's personal life; which, if you haven't seen this movie I guarantee you, you don't. Masterful in its retelling and transitions between individual ""sub-plots,"" which both stand alone and also contribute to the greater theme and advance the narrative to a finale of nail-biting intensity",5
100958,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,Eye opener to what technology can offer. It is very useful yet very dangerous if mishandled. Hopefully everyone became responsible in using this gift.,5
100959,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Very good, i am not paranoid but it doesn't mean someone isn't watching me. Confirms a lot of what a lot of awake people already know.",5
100960,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"It's a great movie based on true story, it shows us how the government will misuses it's power to control and maintain its supremacy on common people.",5
100961,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Liberals like myself may see this as an unfair indictment of the Obama administration (which in part it is) but if you watch carefully, the private violation of individual citizens, started way before during Bushes time, and at the end, there's a snippet of Trump calling, not to subtly,  for Snowdons execution. More an indictment against governments business as usual outlook. The film is a compelling thriller. Joseph Gordon Levitt gives a tightly wound performance and is aided by an all star cast, including a luminously beautiful Shalline Woodley. An interesting , thought provoking film.",4
100962,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"A very important film, from Snowden’s   intense book! A hard story to tell, technical, complicated, & often difficult to completely follow, but so important! Stick with it. Read his story. He is a brilliant, clever, honorable man!",4
100963,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"As I was watching the movie, I wondered who had written it. My first guess was Snowden’s PR firm. When I realized it was an Oliver Stone Movie, I figured My guess wasn't completely wrong. Now having said that, I enjoyed the movie tremendously. Then again, I describe myself as an old Berkeley liberal.",4
100964,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,Some slow parts but overall very compelling and enjoyable for a political news junkie like myself. Nice to see the real snowden at the end and enjoyable post clips.,4
100965,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,very interesting and the kind of movie which stirs up a fire in you to fight for the right things! absolutely amazing!,4
100966,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,I love the movie! Joseph Gordon Levitt was amazing as Edward Snowden. Hands down best performance for Joseph Gordon Levitt.,4
100967,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,It's a must watch especially for the young generation so that you can use internet in a better way i.e secured way.,4
100968,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Shailene Woodley look beautiful wearing Central Characters. Good Movie 👍 !,4
100969,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"It takes a maverick like Stone to produce a thought-provoking film like Snowden - solid, enlightened filmmaking with a Hollywood touch that makes it accessible to even the most ignorant",4
100970,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,The scariest movies are those that pull back the curtain on power's corruption in our own country.,4
100971,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"If you’re interested in Ed Snowden, watch Citizenfour and read Snowden’s memoir, Permanent Record. IMO he is one of the most heroic Americans in the history of our country. He wasn’t the somewhat unsettled, uncomfortable figure portrayed in Oliver Stone’s movie. You don’t have to take my word for it, though — watch Citizenfour and judge for yourself. He’s a remarkable individual: computer smart but also erudite, cerebral and an exceptional critical thinker, a thoroughly moral and reasonable human being. His lineage is astounding — every descendant has served America admirably, and he is the best of them, with a bravery that puts our so-called “leaders” to shame. I am so sorry that I voted for Barack Obama because of his role in the wake of Snowden’s revelations (as well as for other reasons not relevant here). Partly because of Joe Biden’s shameful role in trying to close the rest of the world off to Snowden, I am very happy that I did not vote for him. History will see Edward Snowden as one of America’s greatest heroes and both Obama and Biden as two of our most corrupt, amoral elected officials. But you need to see Laura Poitras’s Citizenfour documentary and read his own memoir, Permanent Record, to get the fullest sense of this great American. Oliver Stone’s movie, while entertaining, fails to bring the real Edward Snowden to life.",3
100972,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Yes, it was fun many technical things were being discussed as i m not an IT guy so wasn't able to enjoy every technical things but yea tapping of keyboard and algorithms display on screen of monitor was enough for me to consider the man was a computer expert. Additionally there is a showcase of good sensual chemistry between edward and her hot girlfriend who in movie was shailene so my are eyes are been blessed haha Eventually life of snowden is described perfectly lot's of spending of money has been done after this movie so All in all this movie is for the people wanna watch how Edward Snowden shaken the roots of USA and disclosed the reality amongst people how their privacy is not in their hands.",3
100973,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Glad to see Snowden's story made into a movie. But, not really impressed by Joesph Gordon Levitt's portrayal of the character. Especially his voice modulation and delivery of lines, trying to match the real Snowden, is not good, it's way off.",3
100974,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,Worth a one time watch - mostly for JGL's acting and the story itself. It's more subdued and quiet than one would've expected but then again atleast it's not over - dramatised and that's a relief!,3
100975,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"The movie seemed as if it was just empty and full of irrelevant doubt, often switching in an unorganized fashion. Between his personal problems/work problems and meeting a potential big character.",3
100976,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,This movie give me goosebumps.,5

100991,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"I’m enamored with politics and history and this was one part of history I really paid attention to because it was significant...it changed the course of our reality now. Let me be clear...Joseph Gordon Levitt is my favorite actor and a great actor nonetheless. This role however was not it. This is the first time I’ve seen him make his character so one dimensional. It’s not his fault or his co-stars, whom ever filmed this was probably high or tired. The script...again boring and dry...it’s almost as if they purposely tried to make one of the prolific incidents during our era seem so..so.. minuscule. I’d skip this movie, it’s a waste of an hour. Reading the news columns are much more time worthy.",1
100992,Snowden,2016,Thriller/Drama,"Stone, as is his customary patronizing  self, had to add strip clubs and silly fillers to what could have been a great movie, that writes itself.  École Int? Just to flex his “ I know how things work” muscles? Please.Why do we need Stone to make this swill when Citizen Four  is the real thing?But no, he couldn’t pass up making this into a gum chewing ,big word dropping bro-fest. This passed over so many important elements.",1
