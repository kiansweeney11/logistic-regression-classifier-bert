129,TP,Overall really good movie One Nolans top 3 films me The action sequences amazing cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytema top notch Only criticism I sound mixing bit off At times I really hear saying hey I still understood doing If I could give 455 A piece advice pay attention If get bit next scene explain it
130,TP,I started watching movie back made ten minutes in The plot confusing gave little context The characters also talked sound whispers About month later armed captions airplane screen I gave another try It took while I finally finished it And confusing I still fully understand main gimmick movie I still thought great The characters little details define amongst one another like Neils snark Protagonists fast speech The flaw lack explanation I know thats kind movies point still I needed bit fully grasp all Great movie would recommend anyone 2 half hours kill
131,FN,Well conceptually interesting idea film Nolan puts together pretty good action packed movie like Bond type villain schemes vs true mind bender could been The idea going back forth time time travel This inversion time  time started running backwards How would work What someone future figured out fell wrong hands That movie nutshell Like Nolan films watch twice miss stuff first time watch it
132,TP,I honestly enjoyed inception Action top tier score great clever overall storyline The fight airport the second time proves good Nolan things like this clearly speciality flawlessly messing time well messing audiences heads
133,TP,I crossed giving three four stars I thought movie visually stunning great actors amazing special effects However plot humble opinion much complex effectively follow I mostly understood end really bugging 90 percent movie I understand half going on I prefer Christopher Nolans movies one good well
134,TP,Tenet mind boggling movie watch many layers I really didn’t get plot movie mid way through It suspenseful multiple twist turns kept captivated edge awaiting anticipation going happen next I recommend movie it’s definitely mind stimulator
135,TP,time I got lost movie understand whats happening I still liked entertaining action scenes kept watching I also predict whats going happen next kept glued screen one movies I watch understand whats going whats about I remember thats about something time travelling short trips future saving world I recommend watch it kept glued seat👍
136,FN,Tenet excellent everything expect going Nolan movie At time brilliance movie one gaping hole movie emotionally absent say movie little emotional core The movie one goal aims achieve masterfully forgets ever bring back earth occasionally falls trap getting distant characters point end revealed I really care I spent enough time anyone At time Nolan made brilliant mindbender emotionally empty movie
137,TP,The concept less simple But understanding scenes making connections quite difficultwell nolan movie less excepted him He literally loves play mind This movie scifi thriller also lot action Though movie good like movies quite masterpiece However I need watch again
138,TP,If type person enjoy actionthriller use brain likely love movie Not perfect still one best action movies Ive seen entertaining supremely visually engaging There might plot holes uncover second watch also plethora secondary tertiary details uncover too
139,FP,Great photography    excellent actors    great special effects    great sound track    could I follow going    all For shame director like Christopher Nolan could provide us great movies like Inception The Dark Knight could significantly miss mark movie I really really really wanted like movie I enjoy it For escapist actionadventure exciting exhilarating bit sex humor thrown good measure If like type SciFi actionadventure I would recommend Live Die Repeat Edge Tomorrow Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Bill Paxton
140,TN,A clunky predictable narrative poor characterisation repetitive exposition subsequently flowery uninteresting dialogue would feel home student film first draft Nolan epic However ambitious action set pieces alongside Nolans technical competence offers redeeming qualities make Tenet gorgeous film see hear bigscreen even story ultimately feels redundant times boring That said I felt concept inversion things played reverse translated poorly onscreen often appearing goofy offbeat For example seeing films muddled fat emo super villain running backwards bought laughter audience instead dread  thing missing Benny Hill theme
141,TN,The storyplot couldve executed better this plot heavily dependent action sequence happened weakness Nolan played audience here making us watch thing twice lot predictability Making plot complex reason make interesting either another Im dying Im taking world me I protecting bad husband take lover time reversed nothing special rather waste time Why military special ops involved films protagonist whos rich billionaire abusive Actors actresses good The film whole couldve lot better overhyped Nolan
142,FP,The actors felt stagnated beginning grew 2nd half scenery beautiful I watched IMAX I say I surprised many great reviews This film way confusing lots seemed extra action scenes think overhere go again another scene seem feasible happen getting random people departments together shot turn unravels right afterward easily throwing away went great effort get I wish depth plot
143,TN,The Tenet must make muddled repetitive mess movie and usual Hollywood time travel movie thats get The characters movie seem find inverted  going time backwards something new yet movie making one Hollywoods oldest tricks dating back Thomas Edisons first films Like TV episodes flashbacks montage scenes previous episodes number movies time travel theme concept affords or rather saves director need generate material Where mostly happens Tenet lead to and car chase sequence become pretty standard action films Watching scene again which winds pretty much whole movie slight variation camera angles and oh somebody others car flipped Or gosh I see car door open thats fascinating Naah same again Plus whole theory inversion time travel explained mumbles thankfully hide screenwriterss complete lack of well theory And course usual again get explication little chunks scattered film The lead actor especially prone unintelligible dialogue much help indistinguishable stage presence Not sure thats fault rather direction editing The movie sequel promoting ending I guess Tenet 2 could possibility unfortunately Oh I get it For Tenet 2 theyll remake Tenet 1 except inverted Ugh
144,TN,Horrible movie Even piece film direction cinematography sound disturbingly choppy unsightly painful eye ear The director may made great movies past one deserves failing grade The first 20 minutes film intriguing lead viewer believe going epic journey travel on The next 20 minutes saw story fall completely flat next 2 hours waiting movie end People like movie seem fantasy fan club story doesn’t need make sense make they’re interpretation They say “oh don’t get it” well fact nothing get The story line follow many holes even give benefit doubt Story gets F grade We get personality connection main character even supporting character seemingly likable little personality either Then half movie duped thinking we’re supposed deep emotional connection heroin story connection simply exist The last hour movie turns mindless chase sceneexplosionanticlimactic cliche leaves uninterested entire story completely vanished Kenneth Brannah Ukrainian villain redeeming quality movie 2 thumbs way way down See yourself I wasted time disappointed
145,TN,Speach muffled louder music score part sound production work occasionally set mood scene remaining 90 film speach meant heard explain plot almost uninteligible As SciFi nerd dreadful film jumping seeming reason locations set pieces neither clear plot line needed made sense whole constructing film  many unconnected locations Sci Fi within premise made sense contradictory Half idea poorly written confusing mess direction Fight scenes far close views chopy editing many fights lost sense  true cliche white  black hero  villan confusing I skipped end fights find happened made sense sequences
146,TN,One meaningless wastes 2 12 hours which felt like 5 Ive movies since last Bad Boys Not real human character emotion could seen The story  it incomprehensible matter many times watch it To say acting flatfooted generous fault And accompanying noise soundtrack beyond grating Even visuals usually Christopher Nolan strong point endlessly repetitive hap hazard I truly expected something compelling anticipated postcovid release instead found Mr  Nolans massively expensive opus empty message entertainment Donald Trumps campaign ads James Bond cant return soon
147,TN,This film little excitement except protagonistlead showed talent despite lackluster storyline nothing much exciting might hold good flow The graphics cinematography engaging offered connection captivating story It honestly rather ridiculous backwards forwards flashback back dizzying dull While stayed awake I hoping drift even 15 Many reviews Ive read remind modern art museum blank pale blue canvas critics describe mesmerizing

390,FN,So yeah overall movie still definitely worth watch I recommend paying attention movie understand what’s happening type movie pay attention understand what’s happening movie maybe watch 3 Matrix Movies one know everyone yeah don’t I think would give better grasp movie about
391,FN,It interesting say least Knowing Lana Wachowski trying capture movie  love story shows repeating cycles history never go way  really helped potential disappointment movie
392,TP,The downfalls sadly glaring me I wish new Morpheus name  cool drastically different deserved respect character I fan meta movie was wish story could separated away trilogy continuing sequel without whole the matrix game dozens clips original movies randomly disbursed throughout people fanboy game explain meant Also really Neo depressed John Wick Speaking ofdepressed  reawoke existential crisis matrix social expectations currently live in kept night tossing turning questioning really matters life break free doesnt I still answer anxiety Lana ever read review please finish freeing mind Im currently stuck Mobil station
393,FP,First all Mr Smith He kept calling Neo Tom he typically says MR Anderson never felt like smith Neither Morpheus fact Morpheus somehow Sentient Niobi still alive takes away prior movies It feel like matrix Also I think something whole Wachowski turning female plays part giving Trinity powers THE ONE Feels like tried add female roles even ending Rage Against The Machine Wake Up Cover female As well trying connect many pieces first movie really seemed like tried hard achieve first movie did I cant say I liked it The ending also really show probably started war The machines I guess trinity THE ONE well important
394,TN,Huge matrix fan I cant get passed fact theres real reason movie made plot plot really The story ended 3 also cant get passed replacement characters fact replaced them understand going for just feel like characters tho easy nail Mr Smith Come on weak notmatrix action scenes remember agent put anxiety you What goal here I hate ruin nostalgia great stories watering quantity make quick buck thought matrix better
395,TN,I struggled give movie two stars glad I go pay see it truly felt like game thrones fanale The directors trying much one film The fight sceneswhich numerous rather bland compared original trilogy I excited see matrix get breath life movie seemed stale totally reliant nostalgia They brought back characters either spend time replaced actors like Morpheus
396,TN,I cant believe Im giving movie 2 stars I absolutely love matrix sequels plus animatrix This movie even echo them It feels lower budget original thing I conclude wachowskis team input visual styles combined make great movies Lanas direction mehalso maybe covid lockdowns made movie harder create The colors shooting style green filters matrix way differentThe characters seem worn The Smith actor calls neo Tom Mr Anderson acting style way way off The cinematography made orginal amazing absent
397,FP,I loved trilogy movie mess You tell really wanted somehow recapture special something first movie came across flat The first movie spectacle new improved ideas bullet time decent story cool questions deep thoughts apply simple things like real This movie seemed favor prior film allusions cuts especially slooooow first half spectacle nothing wowed like bullet time in fact times I thought cgi cringy filled shortcuts sometimes poor quality sometimes replicated animations especially faster sequences probably wont take notice first viewing story seemed  belabored stretch frankly batch deep questions posed seemed silly bother pondering given little I ended enjoying movie
398,TN,I wasn’t really sure going movie I thought neo spose like hero but like doesn’t travel around time friend get famous people history book reports And Wookiee I waited space gorilla never showed up Disappointing And confusing sub plot Bitcoin I mean neo keep hinting Morpheus buy Bitcoin ‘Buy Bitcoin Morpheus  buy Bitcoin’  guess that’s afford rad clothes stuff I don’t know happened film ended I couldn’t find car car park I think I saw someone matrix following me Yes agent  I hide fire escape hours I found car I drove home  Something isn’t right home I wonder space gorilla spying me quietly living roof watching coming I’m home eating butter
399,TN,Ive watching matrix movies since launch honest opinion movie mess It good moments story hit home like others did The new characters honestly easily forgettable Jada Pinket pretty much pointless acting like time basic acting lessons again I writer kind I grab laptop start typing away ideas I already make better matrix 4 movie 2 days Oh comedy pointless none hit home If another matrix movie needs much better Now I hope John Wick 4 suck shall see
400,TN,I’m huge fan matrix saw three films I love first 2 films unapologetically 3rd I used hate alot I recently rewatched it’s okay I guess idk it’s mixed bag but This movie worst franchise scenes I cared scenes neo trinity wasn’t enough that movie place hard follow I didn’t know hell going beginning end I say I satisfied ending neo trinity everything else I could care less could Lana W Do beloved franchise new characters I could care less about And I hated The new Morpheus way treated character disrespectful it’s shame movie turned like this hot garbage complete mixed mess And I found Lawrence fishburne wanted come back Morpheus thank God He didn’t movie disaster But like I said I liked ending Neo trinity Now WB probably killed franchise let end hero’s journey overall I give 2 stars I like movie neo trinity scenes wasn’t even much smh  disappointed
401,TN,It ok If want kill 2 12 hours slip back matrix world movie fill needIf hoping see new ideas coming movie disappointed It’s rehash things happened original trilogy except updated times now Plus It’s even love story now But worth watch once I won’t rewatch like I first 3 On side note I think it There really wasn’t real reason bring matrix They didn’t need anything They risk home really nothing bring back nothing bring back Lol Sorry I’m ranting now
402,TN,A real steamy stinky one I loved trilogy I found cringing watching this Starts pretty interesting tbh takes nose dive The plot basically “How Neo Got His Groove Back” Two stars ideas concepts land mark missed entirely The dark weird atmosphere trilogy gone The action scenes I expecting compared others Neil Patrick Harris doesn’t work main bad guy I like actor doesn’t fit world well bubbly silly personality If like Matrix fan good you I wanted like one really try enjoy I couldn’t help sigh roll eyes scenes
403,TN,Honestly disappointed everything film complete change story line coupled bad acting long drawn scenes It like TV series three episodes rolled one Basically took snipets previous movies made nostalgic remake executed poorly hope audience would ignorant see form fresh creativity Then trying change sub plot indicate neo made game called matrix somewhat dumb masses comprehend theres simple answer everything game Morphuiss role personality overall part film mockery This film scary movie matrix films A joke
404,TN,This movie incoherent doesn’t sufficiently explain things got regard two main characters It feel like tried failed many plot holes The fight scenes largely muddled mess They great casting Neil Patrick Harris Analyst I enjoyed seeing every scene in movie whole lost mystique narrative relied far much audience make sense seeing Far experience one carries away like first film tended do movie forgotten audience days seeing it
405,TN,A convoluted plot particular aim points seek free peoples minds bodies breakdown social constructs systematic abuses The matrix Neos etire aim selfserving save girlfriend nothing people around him This script confused pulled many different directions yet actually going anywhere It confused plot made rebel evil system nod it It presents trying woke falls asleep highlighting real issues It use time think question anything really Its felt like waste time really hurt franchise eyes I also think Morpheus agent Smith acting far standard originals I think script proof rumors true
406,FP,This movie slotted 7 PM CW Buffy Vampire Slayer When film nostalgic cheesy promoting transhumanism The film goes new Matrix reality promotes idea feelings perception real facts You know kind like new progressive thought process Its painfully obvious also fact aware directors surgery changed genders makes even predictable painful The film also lacks sort real character development cultural similarity characters obviously heavily dependent sales China plot thin Its worth watch see unoriginal predictable is
407,TN,I doubts first heard read 4th Matrix film proven right It painful watch wait till finished Glad streamed instead wasting money see cinema It bloody awful start end getting frustrating constant jumping back way rehashing stuff 1st 2nd 3rd Matrix acting piss poor especially new Agent Smith guy Morpheus guy story plot place lacked lot elements It felt like horrible cheap nasty remake first Matrix film honestly repeat old stuff less action Even acting felt forced cast lacked everything I like Keanu Reeves even save monstrosity abomination film Hes brilliant actor hes better this I know made one asked it They left 3rd one need another one way 3rd one ended Its 18 years since last one came theres long gap make follow never works proves it Just leave franchise alone ffs Dont waste time money energy seeing folks honestly Its 2 hours 28 minutes life never get back again It bad Resident Evil Welcome To Raccoon City better thats saying lot Its another cash cow
408,TN,I literally finished watching The Matrix 4 I don’t honestly know start This movie embarrassing Keanu Reeves far one favorite actors ever I wish would declined movie reading screenplay Either Lana deliberately trying create terrible movie clearly original writer Third Eye reason fabricated success It seems like spirit guided franchise stardom completely left franchise Every aspect plot pathetic forced right silly comparison flawlessly epic original trilogy The Matrix was They business allowing 4th movie happen  left alone What I would enjoyed would dived multiverse The Matrix assimilation rather assembling knock one sided perspective metaverse spoof There needed better acting well This disgrace  i’m literally going act like I didn’t waste 2 12 hours time Next time put thought actual movie creativity promotion trailers
409,TN,I reluctant watch knowing horrendous character changes it’s thorn I never able get side Smith Morpheus Iconic supporting characters time humble opinion Hugo Lawrence spits face franchise’s legacy Not mention new supporting characters didn’t bring “the sauce” like original movies The action sequences lack luster also felt like story line packing way much unpacked one movie As analyst character I feel could found better darker mind twisting character instead Neil Patrick Harris nothing I think seems place here
410,TN,This movie absolute mess I wonder original pitch The plot terrible The video game premise fan service “what Matrix” Felt like utter fan service nothing move plot whatever was movie edited yet another example Hollywood folks falling love product The movie felt like cosplay bunch fans running around creating version Matrix 4 The fight scenes pretty bad Don’t get started fight scene Merovingians… ridiculous Impotent Neo he can’t fly barely fight loses powers trying save damsel distress find bigger balls oh fly sudden How Agent Smith a program still alive wasn’t code expunged Neo already least wasn’t code purged like The Oracle’s How machines living harmony humans I mean power source It felt like made TV movie often colors feel soap opera… cameras used Why Keanu say yes mess
411,TN,You cant spoil anything bad but readers sake MINOR SPOILERS First off Im huge fan series even taper film preceding one But thismother pearlsthisis bad So I think went relative expectation movie likely going be Neo Trinity Morpheus reunited secretly lovedriven martial arts world warpingscience fictionrealitybending adventure Youd wrong Beyond initial frankly overzealous use inclusion characters yet another woke disaster film As expected main characters namely Reaves Moss absolute best glue keeps whole thing moving Mateen Morpheus seemed lost Im partial acting typically Most cast struggled problem Its auditions held see would best fit role character The core movie hope cheesy agents lackluster effects illcasted characters obnoxiously incoherent storyline this sadly say dumpster fire outside Matrix
412,TN,I didn’t lot hope sequel since trilogy good ending hinting death neo But I could see new plot somehow poorly fitted trilogy When movie already set standard script written costumes cgi special effects set it’s hard see new sequel horribly ignored past movies new technology budget past matrix would think would wanted perfect couldn’t watching it’s lazy done The new millennial language got script made movie joke Morpheus character poorly written making look like unbelievable joke character couldn’t even take serious trilogy original actor portrayed respectable character made whole matrix believable neo audience top awful performance costumes The way whole movie written performed felt like try make bad I words need exist thank matrix trilogy complete
413,TP,I know people hating movie  Its Great movie fun matrix It explains lot takes awhile understand You pay attention connect dots But I loved everything  People need open minds enjoy ride It connected cant wait
414,TP,I really enjoyed movie blending together Matrix movies I absolutely love new Morpheus actor even though I thought going movie I wouldnt Lawrence Fishburn great actor I blown away new actor captured essence Morpheus character Great job great movie
415,TP,Purely enchanting broader scope previous film trilogy Its breathtaking slick stylish action peak benchmark level It absolutely gather followers years come A warmhearted sequel depicting contemporary issues singular awesomeness
416,FN,Pure nostalgia Matrix lovers  New storyline upgrades technology  On bullet time part  could improvement action sequence  maybe like revolutionary bullet time scene  Lana could come something new  Enjoyed  Kudos  Looking forward Matrix 5  improved action  Return Neo  Trinity 
417,FN,I finished watching Matrix Resurrections I say brings back memories first Matrix I remember getting recommended movie started watching it I fell The Matrix franchise I waiting long movie I believe came 22nd time went fast I remember I finished The Matrix Revolutions tried search 4th would come out When I looked release date I thought man Thats long time wait But I wrong I loved movie cannot wait 5th Im rooting Trinity Neo
418,FN,Being big fan original trilogy I really enjoyed it I felt good place take series It pretty much elements originals It bit wrap head around as originals would cool see original cast nonetheless I think awesome movie overall
419,TP,Absolutely great movie Storyline insane A complex movie sure The acting graphics riveting Excellent job tiring together explaining it Personslly I thought tons action even explaining relationship important Best matrix far
420,TP,I liked everything action story I liked plot resurrecting neo Trinity I love love story I almost cried finally kissed This love story makes want love them Everyone played part beautifully I would recommend movie I would definitely watch movie again
421,TP,Im fan Keanu due personality life experience So I little bias may qualify spoiler delivers new outlook Neo next chapter Matrix The movie focuses sacrifice made Neo Trinity last movie sacrafices reuniting chapter Im bit nostalgic loved it
422,TP,Its story Love Flat Earth matrix globe earth zombies believe were magically glued IO 1 0 binary also metaphor male female True love generated 2 humans Male Female yin  yan represent powerful force existence Strong enough snatch souls heaven bring earth
423,FN,I debated giving The Matrix Resurrections three star review however consideration I deemed deserving four stars least IMO Obviously first Matrix set bar high Matrix fan tell sequels parts II  III wrapped original trilogy fashion Times changed thus Matrix I one glad see reinvented still paying tribute originals I think better kickbutt couple movie history outside Neo  Trinity except perhaps Micky  Mallory Natural Born Killers That said believe negative reviews film It certainly better it’s last two films but per usual nothing topped original On side note I thought I would miss Lawrence Fishbourne Morpheus however ended Hugo Weaving Mr Smith I missed most
424,TP,Every one loved first film Resurrections reminds us why While revolution would loved Resurrections offer us fans clamoring action disasterous duology Reloaded Revolutions second chance The action bit slower pacing really smooth Theres plenty call backs past films fun laughs things people hated sequels Seeing Neo Trinity back together fun exciting The third act stellar action While nothing tops lobby shootout anything theres fun Whoa moments make go Wow Matrix suck anymore If got HBO Max hours cant go wrong
425,TP,LOVED IT Love idea behind it course I wish actions scenes I felt things bit rushed story fast I kinda think thats ppls attention span now😅😅 love movie new cast awesome fit love seeing veteran cast well solid blend The potential another Matrix trilogy sequence I hopeful for🤞🏾🤞🏾Now ima Rewatch 3 along animatrix kid fill awesomeness go break video game 😁😁✌🏾✌🏾 great flic watch
426,TP,Okay interesting way end 2021 First off I say The Matrix Resurrections definitely better two weaker sequels The reason though served sequel practically served double purpose reboot modern day Which I thought pretty nice 910 original film franchise series always best case The Matrix still considered top However movie felt sense augmented certain aspects original since referenced many factors it new characters altered plot try revive old franchise NONE us saw coming back especially long Although debatable whether necessary not story technically open continue all movie waste
427,TP,The reactions appraisals critiques valid ultimately good reason Everyone took something different away original movies jam packed trilogy With mind everyones love film solidified resurrections The movie give much food thought disappointment But find love world matrix expanded upon The new agent smith actually terrfic direction Expanding growth program sentient whilst still capturing Weavings identifiable cold attitude Action somewhat disappointing due lack longshots original But even things loved gone philosophy challenges intricate system building matrix lore still gives us 2 cyberpunk heroes 1 chance show young today time fearless And many us want back
428,TP,Like things depend expectations If first Matrix blew mind created life altering experience expect repeated save time money That said I found excellent I thought fantastic job weaving story primarily Neo Trinity world familiar with Matrix They managed preserve level selfdeprecating humor without making light world visiting easy task The action choreography acting work here expected It felt bit like closing chapter turns case close works
429,FN,I rewatched movie second time around I liked better I think okay reboot It allows matrix world explored I assuming movies There confusion first time around cleared second watch Like role Morpheus plays I understand first time around neo purposely made version hopes would awaken him I changed rating 4 Nothing ever compare first This fact And movie watched without reloaded revolutions still stand alone But nice see future may hold interesting stories matrix universe Lets hope pray become like fast furious Cash grab Yes Mostly But I think many people went expecting more I let down Well I say watching opened eyes actually bad
430,TP,Dont go watch expectations like first three It would similar comparing XMen movie Deadpool film DisneyMarvel got right back xmen new ones better world much different way telling story A lot comedy especially studios No spoilers I say I give 5 definitely worth watching catch everything
431,TP,First Overcoming public expectation movie impossible It always doomed heavily panned I enjoyed movie overall Yes eye rolling moments fight scenes little eye rolling dialogue dumb naobis makeup looked terrible I didn’t love ending BUT I loved overall plot I liked meta commentary throwbacks original  I satisfied matrix resurrection ways literal resurrection original movie I won’t go detail I enjoyed watching watch
432,TP,Really enjoyed I found 1st 30 minutes little confusing helped story later As said true love story feel empowering The action sequences good yoo much pointless action like past installments Interesting Trinity one Not tthe best movie I seen good movie matters life I handle that
433,FP,Matrix game changer movie industry nothing special The cinematic lacks much everthing would lokento see great trilogy The amount BS like Trinity able fly nothing solid behind it I loved trilogy one THE best Fantasy special effects movie era This something else made similar quality director team good outstanding movies Just money maker Compare goals Galaxy Wars first 3 good great impact last 3 great distinction graphics Matrix isnt it
434,FP,Well ok going 5 star I think new younger audiences enjoy it However mature thinking movie goer seen 1st one never going compete As reviewers mentioned lost avantgarde cinematography single frame sequences awe wonderment kinda follows lot marvel comic movie style Most all I feel lost NeoTrinity chemistry Acting like daytime soap romance last scene resembled America Lampoon skit let awkward chucklelaugh
435,TN,I went low expectations certainly delivered movie worthy low review This movie lacked feel Matrix movies sense urgency nothing Bad script writing massive plot holes it horrible fight scenes No really horrible fight scenes It actually comical think previous movies The messages All messages They could’ve filmed someone holding big cue cards us read of They really went way that No Agent Smith Heckthey should’ve removed Neo little Trinity get see I’m trying figure even bothered making it But I guess Hollywood sequels prequels right remaking whole movie fit todays timesDon’t waste time money this
436,TN,I waited 18 yrs that What let down If I wanted watch mediocre fight scenes frustratingly confusing storyline I could stayed home watch regular cable tv I don’t understand would take best exhilarating parts Matrix known exclude movie I kept thinking minute something good going happen I’ll get feelings excitement chills I used get watching Matrix But minutes agonizingly ticked clear whoever wrote movie intentions pleasing Matrix fans wanted bore death I probably saw original Matrix movies theater 10 times I walked movie I non entertained Who signed this They fired
437,FP,Really great Cheap laughs film belong in used lighted mood light Its vibe elaborate romance fan fiction bastardized underlying themes conceptualization original film It clunky felt washed served purpose The Matrix gained status due philosophical undertones well executed action scenes This movie failed uphold initial vision lackluster kn fronts I go Matrix laughs I went get mind fed
438,FP,I hopeful long awaited 4th instalment The Matrix series would great I sadly disappointed To wasted opportunity really bring story full circle cement franchise two disappointing movies I ruin movie anyone yet see spoilers All I want say much potential make great chapterend truly magnificent franchise starting one time favourites The Matrix
439,FP,Definitely nostalgia bate The first half needed slow real build action second half The Matrix franchise revolutionary use inventive camera action scenes unusual character traits fight scenes This like PG13 Matrix game All scenes play mechanically characters mild NPCs Monster uber mistake Lawrence Fishbourne major player story We need wait 12 years this
440,TN,Being big fan The Matrix movies high expectation I would call rather disappointing possibly saw expecting something ordinary Post 2 half hours seriously cant even think memorable scene movie except Deja Vu It repeat different set actors Keanu Carrie Ann Moss I think really tried hard give life new movie end movie felt soulless So first movie best  would recon would worst four
441,TN,This movie really good first half failed capture essence matrix It lacked cohesive plot really grasping straws towards end And hoping badass fight scenes sadly disappointed instead get looks feels like group matrix fanboys got together decided make low budget matrix film one dude got uncle Keanu reeves help out They completely neutered Neo Only reason I’m giving 2 star first half crushed feeling stuck matrix told you’re crazy
442,TN,The Matrix redone without style beauty  A hodgepodge unmemorable music  bad lighting  quick cutting sloppy fight choreography mixed shaky camera flavorless gun fights  The CGI par originals nearly two decades ago  Is good thing Its one highlights Matrix Resurrections sadly  Constant flashbacks scenes original movie look cheesy  screams film cant stand  Its great original cast together  bad film justice  Thoroughly long winded  story good enough carry film kind length were forced endure  In end looks like madefortv movie  190 million dollar film  Not recommended 
443,FP,I’ve waiting 20 years 💩 I imagined moment long time Is real Unfortunately real 😔
444,TN,Abysmal Began relatively interesting idea The Matrix game knowing quips remaking product descending incomprehensible farce resembled one dreadful pop videos try integrate scenes movie band recorded soundtrack These scenes original served remind far superior was The rest references original scenes resembled popular scenes original broken long explanations tried clarify going on There enthusiastic girl blue hair ran around like latter day Scrappy Doo trying enliven old product young audience woman one movies terrible impression old woman By finale people began throwing windows I knew felt I always love original Matrix bad really bad
445,TN,Wellwhat major disappointment I skeptical outset I first saw advertised But huge fan trilogy as Ive watched films back back least 30 times I thought ANY new matrix good thingwell wrong I was Put aside awful plot riddled holes dead ends characters zero depth full cheesy one liners unnecessary commentary They even managed turn agent Smith arguably one sinister villains film ever joke A jumped American kid voice child flu presence small French poodle inside fake gucci handbag
446,TN,Yeaahhhh really sucked This movie felt like YouTube channel made sequel The plot starts think going like old movies events lead events finally grand epic finale comes together instead rehashing old idea ultimately lead one unexciting scene movie ends It makes sense me Did use whole budget cast special effects If covid excuse making garbage movie maybe waited make it I aaaaalmost went theater watch thank GOD I didnt Im sick Hollywoods inability take risks make original exciting content instead try made money past matrix resurrections even good time HBO I found phone it The people raring movie anything single star children grow good movies If brain enjoy movie
447,TN,The best part movie it’s callbacks previous 3 I’m disappointed movie multitude reasons The first nerfed Neo Based plot course needs jog memory get back swing things however writers apparently thought wouldn’t come fruition Next every fight scene multiple frames could clearly see pause blows It rigid well choreographed sad whole point 2021 remake explore today’s CGI special effects neither capitalized on Also entire was trilogy based development savior principle ‘The One’ In remake abandoned core story make way new development Overall acting good amongst characters I don’t think remembered terrible failure courtesy writers directors cinematographers Leaving movie open sequel reboot drastically optimistic Ultimately I’m disappointed far impressed The Matrix movies made 90’s cash grab film composed The actors fans deserved lot better
448,TN,I could waited longer I known gonna hw end result It felt rushed confusing  nothing groundbreaking spectacular new fourth installment Matrix franchise The special effects average best acting could aloy better I think multiple takes scenes Keanu Reeves expressed interview Normally watching movie I enjoyed Id go watch couple times  see I missed anything I dozed off Not time  one done This movie terrible I think one BIGGEST sacrifices Keanu made movie reputation looked like shaved cut hair movie ta boot 
449,TN,Disappointing left it matrix revival people wanted The first 30 minutes good Neo wakes up I liked game developer thought crazy I liked added lore happened Resolutions good CGI thats it After Neo wakes up snooze feast long drawn dialogue stuff heard original trilogy The action poor fast shaky cam tell going on original trilogy action perfect I seen better fight sequences Netflix shows They made Merovingian joke character well like everything film They got rid agents Humans matrix coding eyes act like zombies It made clear characters get matrix without phone booth Both Keanu CarrieAnne looked tired story finished new main characters Not two dead characters I could go on good ideas poorly executed Film canon Matrix awakens tech demo canon garbage
450,FP,Ive grown 5 uncles grandfather movie buffs And young one I watched great films The Game The book Eli Aliens Terminator These movies I grew watching knowing good great actors kinds I disappointed less hour in Morpheus really disappointed role He glue besides neo And actor fulfill role Nairobi either It lazily casted rushed reason The graphics fight scenes 1999 were better 2021 movie SmhA Wrinkle In Time better graphics 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
451,FP,I’m writing I watch it Here’s quote movie sums thoughts far “Reboots sell” I excited watch this I’ve fan matrix ever since I watched first film dad The first 5 minutes tacky action sequences throw liberal rhetoric boot I treat way I treat Star Wars sequels I need good laugh I’ll turn on Keanu Reeves told fans he’ll continue making Matrix films long want fun I’m telling stop DO NOT make another Matrix
452,TN,It’s movie Keanu matrix I’m counting part family 3 matrix films precede movie This film it’s separate fantasy There’s dystopian element whatsoever The new characters flamboyant cadence doogie howser top this There’s line around 20 minutes effect Warner bros going make film without Keanu company It’s reference game within movie it’s blatant tell movie going produced one way another It’s slow it’s boring it’s full ridiculous plot twists somehow everything Neo Trinity rediscovering odds I really looked forward seeing movie It’s trailer amazing unfortunately film’s climax lies I wish I thumbs I’ve got two The Matrix Resurrections gets pointing
453,TP,This actually amazing movie I putting various reviews I heard contradicting opinions However I glad I watch made way onto top 5 marvel movies The action movie INCREDIBLE attention detail amazing The characters diverse It good see characters work together family dynamic This movie emotional fun action packed I would recommend movie anyone whether marvel fan someone new marvel need much background marvel knowledge And Harrys midcredit scene sooo good I really hope Eternals 2 I feel like much explore
454,TP,This one marvels best movies opinion The cast characters director cinematography plot everything beautifully done came together well I never felt like movie slow lagged thought plot progressed good pace— enough background story establish characterization time audience build attachments characters The history diversity characters incredible well done The actors great wonderful director fantastic pulling compelling story together I usually favor “gritty” marvel movies like Captain America The Winter Soldier Black Widow eternals risen top 5 favorites It explores new ideas challenges audience exciting I can’t wait watch again I can’t wait see eternals next movie
455,TP,Despite specialised critics saying Eternals beautiful journey Marvels Universe origins Chloé Zhao brought MCU artistic style bring massive franchise new breezeEven though picture 10 main characters interacting screen work one persona feeling well explored individual complexities Highlight Sprite Gilgamesh present beautifully sensibility depth
456,FN,Youve got watch yourselfIts emotional rollercoasterreminding us beautiful heartbreaking humanity worst best absolutely captivating Layers character development reveals unexpectedThe Gods powers flawed beings tooHumanity great influence change outcome existence We powerful realize I loved I cant wait Eternal 2 ok seriously though anyone wandering Dane Whitman I miss Jon Snow lol gonna go full superhero go Sersi At Any rate experience love characters hard love everything bring

459,TP,What critics about This great movie It may slow start needed set foundation story action picks film progresses Though new characters met first time able give one storyline we audience come care characters I moved Eternal go through I believe reason critics gave movie bad ratings much expectation build film well many heavyweight stars included But seriously critics gave Guardians Galaxy glowing review zero expectation movie decent storyline came pleasant surprise Bring Eternals Part 2
460,FN,Definitely usual MCU movie less worthy praise This movie league own Im intrigued world Eternals Some might say draggy I thought right Zhao take time unpacking heavier themes introducing many characters And besides Im sure MCU fans unfamiliar long runtimes ensemble casts The worldbuilding beautiful interesting I wish could got know characters better Go open mind rewarded  beautiful miseenscene cinematography awesome fight scenes
461,TP,This one best movies I’ve seen while It long engrossing way through Funny without cheesy trying hard And plot took twists kept edge seat It definitely wasn’t predictable you’re already familiar source material I’m not My favorite part characters Each one unique made either love them hate them time It’s hard ensemble movie introducing characters first time feel fully fleshed out movie it
462,TP,This movie superb movie uncovered universe marvel The characters awesome enjoyable watch The CGI really well done well especially deviants looked acted like threat And big bad torwards end icarus amazing especially fights fastest speedster alive icarus It reminded dragon ball super Z fast impactful fighting was The story paced well feel overwhelming slow As astonishing captivating even moments characters would building bonding moments I say well deserved movie enjoyable 1010 marvel

464,TP,I saw Eternals first time yesterday night happy report poor critics reviews actually representative film itself Eternals great time probably great time you’d want once scenes unnecessarily long The cinematography visuals brilliant  expected Chloé Zhao – sometimes there’s much plot could moving along The movie excels many things – it’s action sequences top notch though far between CGI great characters fleshed given enough time introduced good gags story features excellent twists huge stakes The representation I don’t care anyone else says also well handled diverse cast first deaf mcu superhero first gay superhero handled organically What movie gets wrong long many conversations characters weren’t needed many drawn landscape shots flashbacks overall it’s great worldbuilding film adds lot MCU it’s one I see returning often I would say Shang Chi Black Widow Good end credit scenes x2 710
465,TP,Eternals Ever wonder different groups MetaHumans DemiGods etc inhabit MCU yet seem impact time new film complicating timeline Canon Never mind sit back relax enjoy fun The Eternals sent Earth protect humans Deviants predatory monsters Arriving Mesopotamia 5000 BC battle Deviants using killer eyebeams super strength etc The locals plucky bunch though menace Eternals spears Druig Barry Keoghan control minds minds hearts soon gifts Throughout history Eternals battle monsters Babylon complete hanging gardens 575 BC Gupta 400AD They sort Prime Directive interfere human conflicts especially causes problems Druig sees Conquistadors slaughtering Aztecs 1521 But nudge technological development along inventions Phastos Brian Tyree Henry Im saying Aliens but Anyway 500 hiatus Deviants return Eternals must assemble more Im always expecting Ikaris Richard Madden say See You Jimmy Scottish accent headbutts monster Thena Angelina Jolie forms weapons cosmic energy like Limerickian likely stab anyone due demented state Mahd Wyry There ten Eternals total numerous characters A coupe interesting plot twists add intrigue An action drama fine vein humour Directed Cowritten Chloé Zhao 810
466,TP,Whilst plentiful use monologue complex times convoluted plot may dampen experience some The Eternals testimony future things come MCU giving us greatest look past MCU since Guardians The Galaxy also double dose look forward future An extensive look history origins universe earth ever present throughout film perhaps much people liking fans hoping theories branches MCU perhaps enough perhaps opening doors opportunity confusion MCU it’s fans ready for The action sequences speak themselves beautifully crafted choreographed emotionally charged points full surprise tension Perhaps MCU entries date may find edge seat For some action may frequent enough agreed upon there brilliant Plot holes loom film extent harshens progression film however unanswered questions odd behaviour complicate plot viewers perspective nothing film gets stuck mud over The visuals cinematography live expect trailer fabulous scenery eye catching sets The Eternals fade away extravagant The film sound job developing character gives wonderful unique aspects large ensemble mixing comedy tragedy action recount It safe say enjoy intricacies shared universe film satisfying It safe say fans cosmic MCU pleased And safe say fans emotional character side MCU walk away glee But may find bit top long slow times The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming Marvel Studios The Eternals 8510
467,TP,Ill honest getting deep Marvel universe one lot feel like rushed big characters roots originate from understand big characters goin get big climatic feel It matter cast diversed I thought actors alone worked well together friend Evan I went see Eternals with would keep telling proud Gilgamesh character strong Asian american felt limits Evan end crying Gilgamesh killed deviant quickly started chant justice Gilgamesh So people connection diverse cast much I understand someone would
468,TP,I pleasantly surprised film Yes long never felt dull me There lot characters kinda silly names welldeveloped likeable This fun superherosmash film quite heavy places pretty emotional focus character plot But still humour throughout cool action pieces I felt whole thing tied together well As others mentioned task introducing many ideas characters already bloated world going hard one I think Eternals pretty good job

500,TP,Finally scifi franchise butchered political agenda bad writing story telling profit driven decisions cultural engineering wasted budgets Dune 2021 benchmark puts trash franchise killers shame This everything right rest wrong After rubbish Star Wars Sequel Trilogy Star Trek Discovery Kelvin Timeline Masters Universe Foundation  cant even get 10 minutes pretenders Dune visually stunning coherent The story telling flows characters compelling get invested them It pretentious forced feels naturally immersive Lots great material work editing justice creates flow keeps turning away Screw writers think clever think divided fan base sign success This one get watch once Go enjoy it
501,TP,So expound little bit new Dune movie It faithful reflection book good Villeneuve subtly rammed dense references source material Couple bits left the dinner party example Bombadil style forgiven that 25 hours long time whilst pleasing amount exposition literally flew by My friend sitting next who read book felt same I say perhaps emotional connection quite Id hoped  first half book meant quite harrowing great unique movie relegates Lynch version deserved place dustbin history ‘The feeling I saw A New Hope Fellowship Ring possibly not could fact I older jaded In opinion however best scifi movie since Return Jedi ‘83 But different  Star Wars source material thinner childlike adapting effectively literature pinnacle genre themes deeper darker adult  thats reason non scifi fans also see it I particularly like RomComs I love ‘When Harry Met Sally Bladerunner 2049 visual treat lacked resonance source material original Game Thrones went slowly downhill veered books The source material Dune arguably best class movie justice Its always good experience best class even unfamiliar genre Villeneuve deserves lot credit movie
502,TP,hands one best movie It match book well cant wait part two book one Director Denis Villeneuve compiled beautiful collection scenes truly sight see One thing you’ll notice cinematography seamlessly compliments many elements film Dune masterfully shot could watch movie mute still entertained Unlike original film TV series plot easy follow Despite dense scielements MORE
503,TP,This film incredibly beautiful sets costume design special effects cinematography faces actors Each scene mesmerizing It’s stand alone film ends abruptly But really real complaint I’m hoping more The directing friend actors even Jason Momoa seemed believable The camera loves Timothee Chalomet His face sculptural sand dunes amazing architecture The amount comedy right Overall total blast feast eyes Remarkable job creating alternative universes

513,TN,Plodding predictable didn’t nearly live hype trailers Cinematic epic storytelling times yet gets bogged slow plot frequently can’t wait put misery Unless you’ve read books there’s nearly enough backstory characters don’t really know who’s who CGI effects incredible times cheesy others One scene entirely believable effects perspective next scene completely laughable It’s almost like ran money visual effects properly throughout entire movie Josh Brolin Jason Mamoa much better actors characters portray onscreen live artistic potential Ditto Baron Stellan Skarsgard looks partly like Jabba Hut Speaking which Dune seems borrow heavily Star Wars looks like Tatooine Thematically it’s part religious allegory Paul Jesus or Messiah also seems borrow heavily Muslim faith There much foreshadowing many “Chekhov’s guns” the ring knife bull’s head trophy etc movie know you’re going see throughout movie Dune obviously sets sequel I’m sure bring lots money Warner Brothers spite many shortcomings I feel like Dune much potential end total letdown Two half hours life I’ll never get back
514,TN,The title Dune best describes nothingness story movie Actors look like models front camera pretending saying something interesting opinion story care about So far movie could best screensaver could pc visual entertainment My total admiration talented professionals animators designers engineers worked behind cameras craft sublime piece art
515,TN,The visuals great I must admit Other always kept waiting something happen This movie boring They could squeezed kind boredom hour half movie Four us went four us agreed stunk Does anybody care reality anymore There scene crash planet high speed And walk ship without scratch Just like comic book movie Visuals go far  Want bored  Go see movie My scoreD Im feeling kind tonight
516,TN,In perspective long boring beautiful looking SteampunkUtopia Scifi The script enough strong meanings intentions Its vision sand dunes scifi civilization far future The costume actors character well crafted The machines transportation super coollooking manmade creations blends together concepts DUNE Plus action scene sometimes bit awkward weird simply interesting especially Tilgar gets killed Paul Atreides toooooo awkward But I feel enough true meanings intentions point making coollooking world I think director needs time create good scriptwriting physical looks impressions I want get know character

519,FP,I super excited film especially seeing many previews I work movie theatre But surprisingly I disappointed The visuals film music pretty great parts movie I got lost I clue going on I don’t want people coming telling I read book cuz I actually didn’t know book till Dune came out I watching best friend fell asleep lmao And I also pretty bummed didn’t feature Zendaya much since I excited see movie I felt barely got screen time  scenes beginning also end Overall I’ll probably prefer new Bond movie different film movie I watched🤷🏻‍♀️
520,FP,Why guys make long end movieI understand boy powers play girl dreams short notice also horrible fight scenes thought fat floating men black liquid yo random scene Bastia getting mad comedy Action Also dreams never happen kinda boring repeat move kingdom across galaxy part like yo gone waste 2hr 30mins life least let us see deaths fights It cool teeth poison killed guys Then famous actors minor roles could possibly cheap film It keep entertained I would rather bit action less dramatic
521,FP,Great visuals interpretations novels technology However movies need impressive visuals good Acting throughout movie roller coaster many ups downs generally average  subpar Some characters may miscast may good actors suited roles depicted particular film Theres much exposition dump could relegated characters conversation could helped world building lot important subjects unexplained leave unfamiliar novel guessing Some aspects film even downright silly fit serious story Dune If want spend couple hours admiring stunning visuals ought see it If looking excellent movie one
522,TN,I love cast much theyre amazing actors movie really really boring A 212 hr movie action part starts happen somewhere close end Let alone first part story I understand crew wanted detailed much To fair I watch Dune 1984 however personal matter certain scenes I felt uncomfortable watching it could I understand original story book feeling there Dont get wrong characteristics character interesting sand spiceif Im mistaken I kinda slept time time movie Hopefully sequel long one makes understandable sense arent dune fan like myself
523,FP,Amazing art direction best CGI Ive ever seen The scifi tech conceptions breathtaking At two  12 hours seems twice long Half movie long long loooooong lingering caressing shots Timothy Chalomet may beautiful boy Hollywood history interesting sympathetic Where Kyle MacLachlan may bland 1984 Chalomet alternates blandness teenage moodybroodypoutywhiny angst I seeing Part Two
524,FP,If negative stars existed I would use them The character development flatter moldy soda Literally scenes less organized chilli came rear end I never ever thought straight man would dream Zendaya ever much within two half hours screen time yet are Dune absolute pinnacle terrible movies created 21st century I rather watch Avatar movie repeat rest life see second absolute cancer And lastly Paul mom totally spicy things scenes doubt it
525,TN,Good Please…I saw Lynch version which considering special effects available wasn’t bad understood beginning end…this wasn’t anything like it My husband never watched Dune doesn’t know storyline fell asleep over I continuously stop movie on HBO MAX explain background info Afterwards I played Lynch version Oh My Gosh I couldn’t tear away understood background story despite dated special effects Now wait Dune 2 possibly 3 Not us  save money buy Director’s Cut Lynch’s movie You won’t regret like watching version

541,TP,What incredibly amazing action movie To astonishment film exceeds I expected starting watch it especially energetic force feminine martial arts mindblowing stunts Even film definitely surpasses Bond movies particularly aerial battle left totally speechless The supervillain Taskmaster strong Black Widow family brainwashed boss General Dreykov All Black Widow agents confront darker past Red Guardian go destroy Red Room brainwashes female agents red vial frees mind Well done superb job extraordinary action film
542,TP,This movie well done typical lighthearted marvel movie The theme movie highly surrounds real reality human trafficking including almost traumatizing minute long montage beginning young children kidnapped put trafficking me mom almost left theatre intense was There quite bit violence—more typical marvel—and bit swearing mostly Russian However acting incredible film chemistry characters charts Marvel wonderful job bringing light Natasha’s past also bringing closure it I would highly recommend MATURE AUDIENCES Please show film children
543,TP,Like first solo venture BW must go great detail Natashas past If comic buff usually puts enthusiasts bed Not due poor quality lack continuity simply know story want get significant portion exposition Nevertheless introduction Taskmaster Russias version Capt America somewhat pleasing eye lacking bit volume especially Taskmaster However ending makes lack familiarity relative exposure often take granted If could instances Taskmaster CLEARLY mimicking opponentWOW All all I give standalone MCU venture 7 10 Not bad first solo film Mrs Johansson
544,TP,Its fun nice movie overall good fleshing Black Widows general character story The qualms I really movie release released right Civil War impact stronger allowed deeper connection audience Black Widow This movie also issue advertised antagonist Task Master quite underwhelming Although I know movie anywhere near Task Masters story even require character fleshed out would nicer advertised villain developed Other solid movie solid story helps add depth characters new old MCU
545,TP,An entertaining blockbuster amazing performances round As MCU film one greatest sure adds extra dimension Widows fate Infinity war never negative The villains fell short heroes amazing action sequences made it A movie worth going back theaters excellent performances made left wanting new cast members
546,TP,Black Widow spy thriller action packed film The first 30 minute like nonstop action action packed The whole film tells story Natasha 5 years ago Natasha going back haunted past Taskmaster Now Taskmaster big disappointment Dreykov project main villain turns Dreykov Its kinda like Captain America winter soldier main villain Alexadra Pierce winter soldier project villain film great Some moments film thrilling especially fight Taskmaster bridge The film also like PG13 Mature dark tone probably one darkest film MCU The action film makes whole film like full action car chase bridge fight prison break sister reunion red room fight Well kids 13 watch action violence it Another thing I really love character character reason MCU franchise successful franchise The character backstory looks satisfying emotional thrilling moments family reunion also emotional The whole film little small whole film journey Natasha going back past The villain super evil plan Now film story feels kind late I really care much
547,FN,Alright somethings could better done but standpoint Audio design scriptwriting filming CGI really good movie Its serious marvel movies bit James Bond The thing I liked movie female characters woke feminists trying take male gender wonderwoman 2 that Their characters Im female It something else average superhero movie The things could better were Character writing longer shots Norway widdows acting overall Highly recommended
548,TP,Excellent Film Not best Marvel installment I would consider somewhat toptier addition It flaws timing release obviously way late global pandemic right I liked people mainly lived hype exceeded expectations Amazing Cast ActionI loved it I would say worth 30 Disney want go route Theater place go one folks
549,TP,This SOOOOO much better I thought would be I expected marvel put much effort surprisingly well done easily one better marvel films Love good standalone action film feels like one MCU I wish used Russian actors main cast however actors well regardless
550,TP,I cant understand film 6810 Im honest I thought solid 75 well put together fight scenes brilliant Russian accents were The setup Hawkeye series also big plus Florence Pugh arguably stand film The red guardian brought back another thing set marvel films apart earlier DC films humor
551,TP,Well black widow great movie I say brought new side character new 10 years I loved I also loved Florence Pugh yelena outshines black widow many ways Black widow sense humor yelena poses thats good one  I love end blowing flying air cool also I love story line girls controlled stop parents funny bad came way late 5 years late came time maybe yelena could infinity war engame came character dead I say watch movie also like combat going love this
552,FP,From mind numbing nonbone breaking bloodless action conceited short sighted social commentary ITS ANOTHER MARVEL MOVIE BY DISNEY And good The titular character side character movie The ham fisted girls get done evil masculine overlord mindless female army reflect continued shallow approach female empowerment female empowerment  falling things including literally exploding things without taking damage Much like Captain Marvel action scenes tension female characters appear invincible lunge action scene action scene events would kill maim average human 10 times over The cartoon villain plot undermines gravity family themes well social commentary overall movie made round ScarJos contractual obligation Disneys Marvel MARVEL FAN BOYS WILL LOVE IT Children probably mostly bored it
553,FP,Honestly tired predictable marvel movie since Thor 2 Everything feels forced paint numbers Now said marvel movies least felt like made purpose mind story tell Black Widow feels like made obligation Genuinely shame too everyone feels like theyre trying hardest make feel compelling plot somehow needlessly overcomplicated totally boring once Sure action scenes well done effects stunning ever everything looks like should feels like weve reached point feels forced coming someone loves franchise deeply passionately For character much intrigue mystique surrounding Black Widow thought theyd able keep audience engaged actually care whats going on instead get slew new dull characters throwing tired quips always half charm double preachyness Do better marvel want to
554,FP,A long waited film lot people Black Widow hyped different “grounded” side MCU show story everyone’s favorite Avenger But worth  No plain simple  While film show lot good ideas it’s flawedawkward unoriginal action movie barely makes one forgettable MCU movies  Johansson back title character good job again With Yelena Belova played Florence Pugh good addition They good believable sister relationship jokes makes actual good jokes movie  David Harbour Rachel Weisz play Red Guardian Melina Vostokoff work good together feel tacked anything else  Actually whole movie feels tacked  The action scenes lackluster Not impressive scenes characters MOST human defy laws gravity  The whole message overall feel film feels pretentious  It’s trying go dark dose I’ll give movie try achieve tone it’s inconsistent The villains greatest taskmaster who’s mercenary photographic memory comics reduced walking robot twist reveal super obvious Overall Black Widow isn’t really satisfying film barely enjoyable  I give 610
555,TN,I really looking forward movie sadly disappointed After first hour beginning good promising story seemed audience fragmented many holes supposed plotline Writing could SO much better Sound editor fired volume movie would increase significantly action sequences which make sense The main characters sister Florence Pughs Yelena Belova enjoyable addition actor talented seemed get best lines So opinion audience myself save  wasting hardearned money view it must streaming or DVD multiple people Unfortunately diehard Marvel fans disappointed film especially waiting long
556,FP,Dont get wrong movie great The action scenes entertaining thrilling watch The humor movie great well Really hass better sense humor MCU movies But way action shots filmed made hard process Plus me feels overhyped Ive waiting movie long time high expectations going theaters But I totally let pacing shot angles even generally confused mindcontrol aspect It really explained well The main villain even explained well opinion His motives felt lacking concept base felt odd many offputting things happening And get started plot twist way predictable enjoy And finally thing Im absolutely furious about Twlight Sparkle 1995 She even wings 2015ish Howd magically appear plushie 20 years prior

558,TN,I think reason movie made boost feminist agenda The reason Black Widow didn’t film original Marvel lineup contributions limited She’s superhero— she’s hired gun And movie reflects that I would rather skip feminist agenda make movie deserves made I could gone without ever seeing movie It like giving Gomorrah film it’s unnecessary I like Black Widow contributes group alone You didn’t even put Hawkeye know love family she literally died him instead random people never mentioned film why talking Steve Endgame I’m inclusion representation it 
559,TN,I think movie good should’ve much better potential make characters like taskmaster terrifying winter soldier 2nd captain America movie black widows character isn’t supposed funny person yet movie insisted lots comedy wasted red guardians character making joke And Natasha didn’t even seem like main character movie Since set past stakes weren’t high since knew would happened basically They also made taskmaster one time villain easily should’ve appeared films tv shows The fights movie also disappointing didn’t explore hand hand combat should’ve Overall disappointment could’ve should’ve been
560,FP,As fan character NatashạBlack Widow I wait solo movie come out And finally came out delayed long I terrified say totally disappointing To watch followed another storyline new case When movie girl became Black Widow It reached Steve Infinity War CIvil War Followed case investigation deals past It would great story second part BLACK WIDOW franchise initiation WE wanted past explored investigation
